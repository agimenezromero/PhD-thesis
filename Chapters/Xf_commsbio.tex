\section{Introduction}
Emerging plant pathogens and pests are costly both economically and
environmentally for society \cite{Carvajal2019,
    Mooney2001,Pimentel2000,Spence2020}. Among valuable crops recurrently
affected
by emerging diseases, the grapevine occupies a remarkable place in the history
of plant pathology \cite{Borkarbook, Brewer2010, Rouxel2014, Tello2019}.
Nowadays, Pierce's disease (PD) is considered a potential major threat to
winegrowers worldwide \cite{Hopkins2002}. The annual economic burden in
California alone has been estimated at over $\$ 100$ million \cite{Tumber2014},
and the disease is a well-recognised limiting factor in the cultivation of
\textit{Vitis vinifera} in the southeastern US \cite{Hopkins2002}. In Europe,
despite strict quarantine measures to protect the wine industry (Directive
2000/29/EC), PD has recently been established for the first time in vineyards
on the island of Majorca, Spain \cite{Gomila2019, Moralejo2019}. This finding,
alongside the detection of PD in Taiwan \cite{Su2013}, has raised concerns
about its possible spread to continental Europe and other wine-producing
regions worldwide.

The causal agent of PD \cite{Davis1978}, the bacterium \textit{Xylella
    fastidiosa} (Xf) \cite{Wells1987}, is native to the Americas where it also
causes vector-borne diseases on many economically important crops, such as
citrus, almond, coffee and olive trees \cite{Almeida2015, Almeida2019}. Xf is
phylogenetically subdivided into three major monophyletic clades that
correspond to the three formally recognised subspecies: \textit{fastidiosa},
\textit{multiplex} and \textit{pauca}, native from Central, North and South
America, respectively \cite{Sicard2018,Vanhove2019}. Although as a taxonomic
unit Xf infects more than 560 plant species \cite{Delbianco2019}, it also shows
genetic variation among subspecies and sequence types (STs) in both host
specificity and host range \cite{Nunney2019}. Since 2013, diverse STs of the
three subspecies have been detected in Europe mainly associated with crop and
ornamental plants \cite{Denance2017, Olmo2017, Saponari2013}; among these, the
clonal lineage of the subsp. \textit{fastidiosa} responsible for PD (hereafter
termed Xf$_{\textrm{PD}}$). The same genetic lineage also causes almond leaf
scorch disease in California \cite{Almeida2003} and Majorca (Spain)
\cite{Moralejo2020}, where it is widespread in almond plantations and
vineyards, affecting more than 23 grape varieties \cite{Moralejo2019}.

A key trait in the understanding of Xf's invasive potential is its capacity of
being transmitted non-specifically by xylem sap-feeding insects belonging to
sharpshooter leafhoppers (Hemiptera: Cicadellinae) and spittlebugs (Hemiptera:
superfamily Cercopidae) \cite{Almeida2016, Cornara2018} -- e.g., at least eight
species transmit PD in the southeastern US \cite{Overall2017}. Such
non-specificity would have facilitated Xf$_{\textrm{PD}}$ invasion after being
unwittingly brought to Majorca around 1993 with infected almond cuttings from
California and its spread thereafter to grapevines through local populations of
the meadow spittlebug, \textit{Philaenus spumarius} \cite{Moralejo2020}.
Recently, the role of \textit{P. spumarius} in the transmission of PD in
Majorca has been demonstrated \cite{Moralejo2019} and its involvement in
epidemic outbreaks in California, previously thought marginal \cite{Redak2004,
    Severin1950}, is being revisited \cite{Cornara2016, Beal2021}. To date, the
meadow spittlebug has been confirmed as the major vector in the olive quick
decline syndrome, PD and the almond leaf scorch disease outbreaks in Europe
\cite{Cornara2018, Cornara2019,Moralejo2019, Moralejo2020}; therefore, its
geographic distribution should be taken into account when assessing the risk of
Xf-related diseases \cite{Godefroid2021}.

The tropical origin of Xf subsp. \textit{fastidiosa} already suggests that PD
is a thermal-sensitive disease, with the temperature being a range-limiting
factor \cite{Castillo2021, Purcell2013}. Thus, the accumulated heat units
(i.e., growing-degree days) required to complete the process from
Xf$_{\textrm{PD}}$ infection to symptom development is critical to predicting
the probability of developing PD acute infections \cite{Feil2001}. Conversely,
the effect of cold-temperature exposures in the recovery of Xf-infected
grapevines is a well-established phenomenon \cite{Feil2001, Lieth2011,
    Purcell1980}, limiting the geographic range and damage of chronic PD in
vineyards in the US \cite{Hopkins2002}. Such ``winter curing'' has been linked
to the average $T_{min}$ of the coldest month, to exposures to extreme cold
temperatures for several days, or to the accumulation of chilling hours
\cite{Anas2008}. The dynamics of chronic infections --i.e., those that persist
from one year to the next year-- are determined by the net balance between the
number of new infections during the growing season and those infected plants
recovered in winter. Because new infections late in the growing season are more
likely to recover during winter than early-season infections, the vector's
phenology greatly influences the dynamics of chronic infections and PD
transmission  \cite{Feil2003,Redak2004,Gruber2012,Daugherty2019}.

Several works have attempted to predict the potential geographic range of the
subsp. \textit{fastidiosa} \cite{Bragard2019, Godefroid2019,Hoddle2004} and
other Xf subspecies in Europe \cite{Bosso2016, Schneider2020} and worldwide
\cite{Hoddle2004} using bioclimatic correlative species distribution models
(SDMs). However, none of these works has explicitly included information on
vectors' distribution or disease dynamics. They hence provide little
epidemiological insight into the underlying environmental causes underpinning
or limiting a potential invasion. An alternative to overcome these limitations
is to develop mechanistic models based on the physiology of the pathogen
\cite{Kearney2009}, coupled with epidemiological models that consider the
disease dynamics while avoiding the difficulties of including transmission
parameters for each of the PD potential vectors.

Risk maps often represent an average snapshot that overlooks interannual
climate variability and the effects of climate change as limiting disease
factors \textit{per se}. This leads frequently to risk overestimation
\cite{Bebber2013,Coakley1999,Scherm1994,Truscott2003}. Increased availability
of computational resources to deal with demanding climate databases now makes
it possible to fit dynamic epidemiological models that include climate
variability at broad spatiotemporal scales. For example, high-resolution
satellite-based climate data have been employed for testing mechanistic models
that relate critical physiological processes of coffee rust with climate
variables in past outbreak events \cite{Bebber2016}. Despite these important
advances, no attempt of exploring mechanistic SDM has been performed yet for
PD.

In this work, we present a temperature-driven dynamic epidemiological model to
infer where PD would have become endemic in different wine-growing regions
worldwide from 1981 onward if we forced the introduction of Xf-infected plants.
We follow an invasive criterion as defined by Jeger \& Bragard \cite{Jeger2019}
to include, as far as we can, key plant, pathogen, and vector parameters and
their interactions for estimating the risk of establishment, persistence, and
subsequent epidemic development. The model assumes a local Xf$_{\textrm{PD}}$
spatial propagation among plants mediated by the presence of potential vectors.
Due to the limited knowledge about the vectors of PD in most wine-growing
regions of the world \cite{Redak2004}, we employ a fixed maximal estimate for
basic reproductive numbers ($R_0$) in the epidemiological models, except for
Europe, where there are precise estimations of climate suitability for the main
vector \textit{P. spumarius} \cite{Godefroid2021}. This heuristic approach to
obtaining PD risk maps yields results that are consistent with all the relevant
data available \cite{Bragard2019}. It also allows us to quantitatively
approximate the current potential growth rate of PD incidence in wine-growing
regions under different transmission scenarios, as well as extrapolate the
impact of PD by 2050 \cite{Webpage}. By estimating a lower global risk of PD,
our study casts doubts on the potential impact predicted for other Xf-related
diseases transmitted by \textit{P. spumarius} \cite{Schneider2020}, specially
in Europe when the vector distribution is taken into account.

\section{Methods}
\subsection{Inoculation tests}

Xf$_{\textrm{PD}}$-inoculation tests were
conducted in 2018, 2019 and 2020. A sample of 36 local, regional and
international wine-grape varieties was selected, which included nine of the
10 most cultivated wine-grape varieties representing more than 80\% of the
worldwide vineyard surface (https://www.oiv.int). Plants were randomly
distributed in 12-plant rows along an insect-proof net tunnel and exposed
to environmental temperature. In total, 57 rootstock-scion combinations were
pin-prick mechanically inoculated \cite{Almeida2003} with two strains of
Xf. subsp. \textit{fastidiosa} (ST1) isolated from grapevines in Majorca.
Disease severity was rated by counting the number of symptomatic leaves eight
weeks after inoculation in mid-May and then every two weeks until the 16th week
\cite{Moralejo2019}. Full details on the inoculation conditions, isolates,
disease score and statistical analysis are provided in \cref{app:inoculations}.

\subsection{Modified Growing Degree Days.}

We generalized McMaster \& Wilhelm’s \cite{McMaster1997} formulation of
growing-degree days to account for the growth rate of Xf$_{\textrm{PD}}$ as a
function of temperature under optimal culture conditions based on the
well-known Arrhenius law valid in the relevant temperature range for Xf
(\cref{app:MGDD}). Specific growth rate ($k$) values at different temperatures
were extracted from the publication of Feil \& Purcell \cite{Feil2001} to build
the mathematical function $f(T)$ describing the Xf’s instantaneous growth rate
dependence on temperature according to
\begin{align*}
     & f(T)=\left\{\begin{array}{lll}
                       0                & \textrm{if} & T<T_{\textrm{base}}
                       \\
                       m_1\cdot T-b_1   & \textrm{if} & T_{\textrm{base}}
                       \leq T < T_1
                       \\
                       m_2\cdot T + b_2 & \textrm{if} & T_{1} \leq T <
                       T_{\textrm{opt}}
                       \\
                       m_3\cdot T + b_3 & \textrm{if} & T_{\textrm{opt}}
                       \leq T < T_2
                       \\
                       m_4\cdot T + b_4 & \textrm{if} & T_2 \leq
                       T_{\textrm{max}}
                       \\
                       0                & \textrm{if} & T\geq
                       T_{\textrm{max}}
                   \end{array}\right. \,
\end{align*}
where $T_{\textrm{base}}=\SI{12}{\degree C}$, $T_1=18$,
$T_{\textrm{opt}}=\SI{28}{\degree C}$,	$T_2=32$ and
$T_{\textrm{max}}=\SI{35}{\degree C}$; the slopes are $m_1= 0.66$, $m_2=1$,
$m_3=-1.25$ and $m_4=-3$ and the intercepts are $b_1=-8$, $b_2=-14$, $b_3=4$
and $b_4=105$.

MGDD is then defined as:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:MGDD_def}
    MGDD(t) = \frac{1}{24}\sum_{\tau \in t} f(T(\tau)),
\end{equation}
where $\tau$ is expressed in hours, $t$ in years and we divide by $24$ to
obtain $MGDD(t)$ in degree days. To compare whether using other functions
for Xf's growth rates in vitro could yield differences in the risk indexes, we
also fitted data to a smooth Beta function commonly used to represent the
thermal response in biological processes \cite{Yan1999,Magarey2005}.

\subsection{Disease progress with temperature}

Hourly mean temperature data were recorded between April 1 and October 31 in
2018, 2019 and 2020 with an automated weather station (Quimisur, IQ2000). The
temperature sensor was at a two-meter height from the bare ground and around
five meters from the entrance of the insect-proof net tunnel. To characterise
the progress of PD symptoms, we converted into $MGDD$ units the cumulative
hourly mean temperatures measured from the time of inoculation to the day of
disease evaluation using \cref{eq:MGDD_def}. In total, 15 $MGDD$ levels were
estimated corresponding to weeks 8, 10, 12, 14, and 16 after inoculation in the
years 2018, 2019, and 2020, respectively. Data on the number of symptomatic
leaves (severity) for each plant and MGDD levels were pooled in a single
database to seek a generalized average thermal response pattern among the
population of \textit{V. vinifera} varieties (see \cref{app:inoculations}). To
model the probability of chronic infections (i.e., persistent year-to-year
infections), we used a survival analysis, where the event of interest depends
on the cumulative MGDD rather than time. First, we defined a chronic infection
cut-off point to transform the number of symptomatic leaves into binary data.
Previous research had evidenced that early grapevine infections, in addition to
producing more extensive and severe PD symptoms, are more likely to survive the
following year than late infections (\cite{Feil2001, Feil2003, Lieth2011}.
Furthermore, susceptible cultivars generally show lower recovery percentages
compared to the less susceptible ones in the field
\cite{purcell1974spatial,purcell1981vector}. Similarly, we observed in our
inoculation assays that the majority of infections that reach around five or
more symptomatic leaves 12 weeks after inoculation continue to develop more
symptomatic leaves the following weeks, while for plants that do not exceed
that threshold, symptoms tend to remain stagnant. These results indicate a low
probability of survival for infections showing few symptomatic leaves during
the growing season and thus support our heuristic approach of assigning five or
more symptomatic leaves as a threshold for chronic infection (see
\cref{app:PD_risk} and \cref{figS1} for assumptions of chronic infection).
Using the ``survival'' package in R \cite{survival-package}, we analysed the
cumulative probability of developing chronic infections as a function of
$MGDD$. $F(MGDD)$ was adjusted to the experimental data by the nonlinear least
squares method. The 10th, 33rd, 50th, 66th, and 90th percentiles were used to
scale the risk of the total $MGDD$ in the logistic function,
$\mathcal{F}(MGDD)$ (\cref{fig1}).

\subsection{Disease recovery through winter curing}

We modelled winter curing considering the effect of temperature duration below
a threshold temperature, where we assume that the bacterial killing process
increases in efficiency with decreasing temperatures \cite{Lieth2011}. To
adjust a probabilistic model to the accumulation of cold units, we took as
reference the distribution and severity of PD in the US proposed by Purcell
based on the isolines of the mean $T_{ min}$ of the coldest month (available in
\cite{Anas2008}) where PD is rare ($T_{ min}$ between $-1.1$ \textdegree C and
$1.7$ \textdegree C), occasional ($1.7-4.5$\textdegree C) and severe ($>
    4.5$\textdegree C). Noteworthy, the projection of these isolines in Europe
has predicted with some precision the distribution of the establishment of Xf
in the continent \cite{Bragard2019}. To capture the accumulation nature of the
chilling process at different climatic zones, we determined the global average
correlation between $T_{\textrm{min}}$ and the average accumulated CDD between
November 1 and March 31 in the northern hemisphere and between April 1 and
October 31 in the southern hemisphere using 6,487,200 points distributed
throughout the planet. The $CDD$ was estimated as
\begin{equation}
    CDD(t)= \frac{1}{24}\sum_{\tau \in t} (6-T(\tau)) \ \quad \textrm{for}
    \quad T_i\le 6\textrm{\textdegree C} ,
\end{equation}
where the threshold $6 \textrm{\textdegree C}$ comes from Ref.
\cite{Lieth2011}.

\subsection{Global climate data, MGDD/CDD computation}

Global mean hourly temperature data were downloaded from the ERA5-Land
dataset \cite{ERA5_dataset} at $0.1^o$ spatial resolution using GRIB format.
The annual average $T_{\textrm{min}}$ of the coldest month was calculated from
the hourly average temperature from the ERA5-Land dataset. To calculate the
annual $MGDD$ and $CDD$ a simple Julia \cite{julia} library was built on top of
GRIB.jl package \cite{GRIB}. For the Northern Hemisphere, the accumulated
$MGDD$s were computed from April 1 to October 31, whereas ($CDD$s) were
estimated from November 1 to March 31, and the reverse for the Southern
Hemisphere.

\subsection{Disease model construction}

We used a standard susceptible-infectious/infected-recovered (SIR)
compartmental model to assess the risk of PD establishment and epidemics
worldwide, represented by the following three equations in the large population
limit:
\begin{equation}
    \begin{array}{l}
        \dot{S}=-\beta \, S \, I/N ,         \\
        \dot{I}=\beta S\, I/N - \gamma\,  I, \\
        \dot{R}=\gamma \, I \ ,
    \end{array}
    \label{eq:SIRmodel}
\end{equation}
where $S$ is the susceptible host population, $I$ is the infected
population, $R$ is the dead population and $S+I+R=N$ is the total number of
vines in the population. The reduction of a vector-borne disease model to a
SIR model gives rise to a linear dependence of the basic reproductive number
$R_0$ on the vector population (see
\cref{app:vector_influence,app:SIR_justifications}).
Vector-plant transmission of the pathogen is approximated with an effective
plant-to-plant transmission rate $\beta$ (\cref{app:SIR_justifications}), as
has been done previously for other Xf-related diseases \cite{White2020}, and
the transition from the infected compartment to the recovered (dead)
compartment is given by the recovery (mortality) rate $\gamma$.  In a
mean-field approximation of the onset of an outbreak, the basic reproductive
number ($R_0=\beta/\gamma$) defines the exponential growth/decrease stage in
the SIR model (\cref{fig1}e, \cref{app:SIR}). Although the time from infection
to vine death depends on the environmental conditions and the grape wine
variety, we assigned a mortality rate of $\gamma$ = 0.2 y$^{-1}$  based on the
estimated median survival time of infected vines in California
\cite{Almeida2003}. The maximum growth rate of the epidemic, relevant for an
estimation of the risk of establishment, occurs when $S(t=0)\sim N$, and was
approximated by the (linearized) differential equation,
\begin{equation}
    dI/dt \approx \beta \, I-\gamma \, I = \gamma\,  I\, (\beta/\gamma -
    1)=\gamma \, I\, (R_0-1) \ ,
\end{equation}
where we have assumed the initial conditions:
$S(t= 0)\approx N$, $I(t = 0)= I(0) \approx0$ and $R(t = 0)=0$. This linear
differential equation can be integrated exactly:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:infect_proc}
    I(t)=I(0)\, \exp(\gamma\, (R_0-1)\, t) \ .
\end{equation}

To account for the effect of temperature in the epidemic process, we modify
the previous expression as follows
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:final_eq}
    I(t) & =I(0)\, \exp(\gamma\, (R_0-1)\, t)\,
    \mathcal{F}\parentesi{MGDD(t)}\,
    \mathcal{G}\parentesi{(CDD(t)} \nonumber
    \\
         & =I(0)\, \exp(\gamma(R_0-1)t)\, \Pi(t) \ ,
\end{align}
where $\Pi(t)=\mathcal{F}(MGDD(t))\, \mathcal{G}(CDD(t))$ is the cumulative
probability of chronic infection, which depends on temperature, and $R_0$ bears
the information on the vector density.

The spatial unit of the model is given by the resolution of the climate data,
in this case approximately $9 \times 9\,  \textrm{km}^2$ as it comes from
ERA5-Land dataset. We assume uniform conditions within each of the grid cells
in terms of vector population, susceptible vines and parameters that define the
model. Risk outcome is calculated for each cell of the spatial raster
individually; i.e., there is no simulated spread from one cell to another.
Altogether, the equation representing the number of individuals with chronic
infections in each cell $j$ at time $t$ is written as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:evolution_eq}
    I_j(t)=\underbrace{I_j(t-1) \, e^{\gamma \,
                (R_0(j)-1)}}_\text{transmission
        layer}	  \overbrace{\Pi_j(t)}^\text{climatic layer} ,
\end{equation}
where $I(t-1)$ is the number of chronic infections in the previous year
($t-1$) and $\Pi_j(t)=\mathcal{F}(MGDD)\, \mathcal{G}(CDD)$ is the climatic
layer that modulates the growth term and describes the cumulative probability
of new infections becoming chronic in the time period between $t-1$ and $t$.
The model assumes a homogeneous distribution of the vector population among
the grid cells (same $\beta$ and then same $R_0(j) = R_0$) except for Europe,
where information on the spatial distribution of \textit{P. spumarius} is
available (see Methods). In this latter case, a spatial dependent $R_0(j)$ is
incorporated into the model by considering the product of the homogeneous
$R_0$ and the spatially-dependent climate suitability for vectors
(\cref{app:vector_influence}).

To compute the epidemic-risk maps, we carried out a simple simulation
summarized in three steps: (i) at the initial condition for the first year
considered, $t_0$, each grid cell is seeded with a single infected plant,
$I(t_0)=1$; (ii) the simulation runs for a year and the incidence is calculated
following \cref{eq:evolution_eq}; (iii) we seed again the cells for which
the
number of infected plants has vanished. In the last seven years of the
simulation, there is no reseeding to allow the system to relax. This
process is
repeated until the final year $\mathcal{T}$. Finally, the risk index
$r_j(\mathcal{T})$ is calculated from the final number of infected plants at
grid cell $j$ as
\begin{equation}
    r_j=\textrm{max}\left\{\frac{
        \log(I_j(\mathcal{T})/I_j(t_0))}{\gamma\,
        (R_0(j)-1)\, \mathcal{T}}, -1 \right\} \ .
    \label{eq:riskmeasure}
\end{equation}
In this equation, $r_j$ implicitly delimits three differential risk zones
in the maps: 1) non-risk zones where $r_j \le -0.09$, and the number of
infected plants decreases exponentially; 2) transition areas where $-0.09 <
    r_j
    \le 0.075 $, and 3) an epidemic risk-zone where $ r_j >0.075$ and PD can
theoretically become established and produce an outbreak --the number of
infected plants increases exponentially (see \cref{app:risk_index} for
further details.)

\subsection{Model calibration and validation}

Model parameters (i.e. $R_0$) were calibrated with observed records of PD
presence in California and the southeast of the US, where the disease is well
established. PD distribution data were collected from publications from 2001 to
2020. Publications were filtered by selecting only records where the pathogen
detection on symptomatic grapevines was confirmed by PCR or Elisa. The
exact coordinates of the records were taken when available in the publication
or approximated to locality or county level
\cite{Overall2015,Vanhove2019,Lieth2011,Anas2008,Hail2009,Wallingford2007,Myers2007,Albibi1998}.
For modelling purposes and to attempt a general rough estimate of the $R_0$
parameter valid for the entire US, we assumed a single vector with a uniform
spatial distribution. We ran several model simulations with $R_0$ ranging from
1 to 14.  Model prediction performance was estimated using a ROC curve by
plotting the true-positive rate (TPR), calculated as the ratio (TP/TP+FN),
against the false-positive rate (FPR), calculated as the ratio (FP/TN+FP),
where PD absence/presence fulfil the following conditions: true positive (TP),
PD is positive and $r>0$;  true negative (TN), PD is negative and $r<0$; false
positive (FP), PD absent but $r>0$; and false negative (FN), PD positive and
$r<0$ (\cite{jimenez2012insights}). A different approach was followed to
estimate $R_0$ for Europe given that PD is only present in Majorca and hence
spatiotemporal data on the PD distribution is limited to the island. First, we
estimated the transmission rate of the main European vector \textit{P.
    spumarius} from the well-studied disease progress curve of the almond leaf
scorch epidemic in Majorca. Then, using the known mortality rate of PD-infected
vines $\gamma\sim 0.2 \, \textrm{y}^{-1}$ and the inferred transmission rate,
$\beta=0.8 \, \textrm{y}^{-1}$, the basic reproduction number for PD in Majorca
yields $R_0=\beta/\gamma\approx4$. Finally, using data on the climate
suitability of the vector in Majorca, $v=0.8$, and inverting the relation
$R_0(j)=R_0\, v(j)$, we estimated $R_0\approx 4/0.8=5$ as a maximal estimate
baseline scenario for PD transmission in Europe (\cref{app:R0_Europe}). This
figure is not intended to be an exact estimate of $R_0$ but rather an average
reference in our model in agreement with the lesser abundance of vectors
relative to the US. Furthermore, since there is no information on the
distribution of the potential vectors and no PD distribution data to calibrate,
we also used a conservative $R_0 \approx 5$ scenario for the rest of the world.

\subsection{A climate-driven epidemiological model}

For the sake of clarity, as the model will be used in the following chapters,
here we provide a more direct and concise description of the model.

Our model describes the initial exponential rise (or decrease) of infected
plants at the onset of an epidemic based on the spatial distribution of the
vector and the bacterial growth and survival processes mediated by temperature.
The density of vectors at a given cell controls the number of new plants that
will be inoculated with the bacterium, while the local temperature mediates the
growth and survival processes of the in-plant bacterial population, leading the
initial inoculation to an infection or not. These temperature-driven growth and
survival processes are described with the accumulation of two metrics denoted
\textit{Modified Growing Degree Days} (MGDD) and \textit{Cold Degree Days}
(CDD). The base function to compute the MGDD is proportional to the Xf
temperature-dependent growth rate and is defined by

\end{align*}
where $T_{\textrm{base}}=\SI{12}{\degree C}$, $T_1=18$,
$T_{\textrm{opt}}=\SI{28}{\degree C}$,	$T_2=32$ and
$T_{\textrm{max}}=\SI{35}{\degree C}$; the slopes are $m_1= 0.66$, $m_2=1$,
$m_3=-1.25$ and $m_4=-3$ and the intercepts are $b_1=-8$, $b_2=-14$, $b_3=4$
and $b_4=105$. MGDD are then computed as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:MGDDdef}
    MGDD(t) = \frac{1}{24}\sum_{\tau \in t} f(T(\tau)),
\end{equation}
where $\tau$ is expressed in hours, $t$ in years and we divide by $24$ to
obtain $MGDD(t)$ in degree days. The accumulation period goes from the
$1^{\mathrm{st}}$ of April to the $31^{\mathrm{st}}$ of October in the northern
hemisphere and from the $1^{\mathrm{st}}$ of November to the $31^{\mathrm{st}}$
of March in the southern hemisphere.

CDD are computed between $1^{\mathrm{st}}$ November and $31^{\mathrm{st}}$
March in the northern hemisphere and between $1^{\mathrm{st}}$ April and
$31^{\mathrm{st}}$ October in the southern hemisphere as
\begin{equation}
    CDD(t)= \frac{1}{24}\sum_{\tau \in t} (6-T(\tau)) \ \quad \textrm{for}
    \quad T_i\le 6\textrm{\textdegree C} .	\label{eq:CDDdef}
\end{equation}

Altogether, the number of infected hosts is described by the following
recurrence relation
\begin{equation}
    I(t)=I(t-1)e^{\gamma(R_0-1)}\mathcal{F}(MGDD(t))\mathcal{G}(CDD(t)) \ ,
\end{equation}
where $\gamma$ is the death rate of infected vines, $R_0$ is the basic
reproduction number of the disease and $\mathcal{F}(\cdot)$ and
$\mathcal{G}(\cdot)$ are sigmoidal-like functions that relate the MGDD and CDD
metrics to the probability of developing an infection from a given inoculation.

To incorporate the spatial heterogeneity of the vector population, $R_0$ in
each cell $j$ can be related to the climatic suitability of the vector, such
that
\begin{equation}
    R_0^j=R_0^*\cdot s_j \ .
\end{equation}

For Europe, we use the climatic suitability of the main vector,
\textit{Philaenus spumarius}, and $R_0^*=5.0$ for all simulations. For the
United States we use a homogeneous basic reproductive number $R_0=8.0$ in all
cells, as this choice of the parameter reproduces spatiotemporal data on PD
epidemics in the US with an area under the curve of $\sim 90\%$. For the rest
of the zones, we use $R_0=5$ because of the lower presence of vectors compared
to the United States.

We use $\gamma=0.2$ as previously estimated \cite{Almeida2003} and the
specific form of $\mathcal{F}(\cdot)$ and $\mathcal{G}(\cdot)$ is given by
\begin{align}
    \mathcal{F}(x) & = \frac{1}{1+e^{-0.012(x-975)}}        \\
    \mathcal{G}(x) & = \frac{2\cdot10^7}{2\cdot 10^7 + x^3}
\end{align}

Finally, the risk index is derived as the effective growth rate of the
infected population over the simulated time,
\begin{equation}
    r_j=\max\left\{-1, \frac{\ln(I_j(T) / I(0))}{\gamma(R_0^j-1)\cdot
        T}\right\} \ .
\end{equation}

Because the typical time scale of the disease is 5 years ($1/\gamma$), we
simulate periods of 7 years. If more years are available
to simulate, we perform a re-introduction of the disease as a single infected
plant in each cell after each 7-year period.

The code used to run the model is freely accessible at GitHub
\cite{CODE_model}.

\subsection{Distribution of wine-grape production areas.} Risk maps were
focused solely on wine-grape regions excluding table and dried
grapes-producing
areas. Data on the vineyard surface in Europe were obtained from the CORINE
land-cover map \cite{Corine} (\cref{fig6}). The Nomenclature of Territorial
Units for Statistics (NUTS) was used as a geocoding for the subdivisions of
European countries for statistical purposes. To visualize the locations of
the
main growing regions in the risk maps, we included dots representing the
distribution of the main wine-growing regions collected from official
statistics and maps from the countries (\cref{fig5}).

\subsection{\textit{Philaenus spumarius} SDM}

The potential distribution of \textit{P. spumarius} in Europe under current and
future (i.e., 2050) climatic conditions was provided by Godefroid et al.
\cite{Godefroid2021}. Predictions were obtained using a generalised additive
model and two bioclimatic descriptors i.e., a climatic moisture index for the
coldest 8-month period of the year and the average maximum temperature in
spring (March, April and May). Both descriptors reflect physiological
constraints acting on life stages of the meadow spittlebug, particularly
sensitive to spring temperature and humidity (eggs and nymphs), and were
identified as good predictors of \textit{P. spumarius} distribution
(\cite{Godefroid2021}). We used the positive relationship between the climate
suitability and spittlebug adult abundance (\cite{Godefroid2021}) to assume no
climatic constraints on vector population sizes at optimal climatic conditions
(v=1). Climatic suitability indexes, $v(x)$, were used to compute a
spatially-dependent basic reproduction number, $R_0(x)=R_0\, v(x)$. The linear
dependence between the basic reproduction number and climatic suitability is
justified by a vector-borne epidemic compartmental model
(\cref{app:vector_influence,app:SIR_justifications}).

\subsection{Risk assessment by 2050}

Climatic variables were obtained with annual resolution by extrapolating the
computed $MGDD(t)$ and $CDD(t)$ time series up to 2050. The observed trends of
the time series were captured using a machine learning-based linear regression
model while the interannual fluctuations were modelled by Gaussian noise
(\cref{app:future}). Future risk extrapolations were obtained as the average of
$10^4$ simulations of this process. A correlative SDM was used to estimate
vector spatial distribution in Europe using the global circulation model MIROC5
and greenhouse gas emission scenario RCP4.5, assuming moderate climate change
\cite{Godefroid2021}. Afterwards, the risk was computed following the same
simulation procedure previously explained.

\subsection{Thermal requirements to develop PD} We examined the response of a
wide spectrum of European grapevine varieties to Xf$_{\textrm{PD}}$ infection
in three independent experiments conducted in 2018, 2019, and 2020. Overall,
86.1\% ($n$ = 764) of 886 inoculated plants, comprising 36 varieties and 57
unique scion/rootstock combinations, developed PD symptoms 16 weeks after
inoculation. European \textit{V. vinifera} varieties exhibited significant
differences in their susceptibility to Xf$_{\textrm{PD}}$ (\cref{tableS1}). All
varieties, however, showed PD symptoms to some extent, confirming
previous field observations of general susceptibility to Xf$_{\textrm{PD}}$
\cite{Hopkins2002, Moralejo2019, Purcell2013}.	We also found significant
differences in virulence ($\chi^2=68.73$, $\textrm{df}=1$, $P=2.2 \cross
    10^{-16}$) between two Xf$_{\textrm{PD}}$ strains isolated from grapevines
in Majorca across grapevine varieties (\cref{figS1}). Full details on the
results of the inoculation tests are available in Methods,
\cref{app:inoculations}, \cref{tableS1}.

Growing degree days (GDD) have traditionally been used to describe and predict
phenological events of plants and insect pests, but rarely in plant diseases
\cite{McMaster1997}. We took advantage of data collated in the inoculation
trials together with temperature to relate symptom development to the
accumulated heat units at weeks eight, 10, 12, 14 and 16 after inoculation
(\cref{app:inoculations}).  Rather than counting GDDs linearly above a
threshold temperature, we consider Xf's specific growth rate \textit{in vitro}
within its cardinal temperatures. The empirical growth rates come from the
seminal work by Feil \& Purcell \cite{Feil2001} shown in the inset of
\cref{fig1}a. This Arrhenius plot was transformed, as explained in
\cref{app:MGDD}, to obtain a a piece-wise function $f(T)$
\cref{eq:MGDD_def}. Our model and risk maps are based on $f(T)$ (red line in
\cref{fig1}a) because it provides the best fit to the experimental data when
compared with the commonly used Beta function (blue line) for representing the
thermal response in biological processes \cite{Yan1999,Magarey2005}. This
Modified Growing Degree Day (MGDD) profile \cref{eq:MGDD_def} enables to
measure the thermal integral from hourly average temperatures, improving the
prediction scale of the biological process \cite{butikofer2020problem}. MGDD
also provides an excellent metric to link Xf$_{\textrm{PD}}$ growth in culture
with PD development as, once the pathogen is injected into the healthy vine,
symptoms progression mainly depends upon the bacterial load (i.e.,
multiplication) and the movement through the xylem vessel network, which are
fundamentally temperature-dependent processes
\cite{fry1990multiplication,Feil2001}. Moreover, MGDD can be mathematically
related to the exponential or logistic growth of the pathogen within the plant
(\cref{app:MGDD_growth}).

Interannual infection survival in grapevines plays a relevant role when
modelling PD epidemiology. In our model, we assumed a threshold of five or more
symptomatic leaves for these chronic infections based on the relationship
between the timing and severity of the infection during the growing season and
the likelihood of winter recovery  \cite{Feil2001, Feil2003, Lieth2011}. This
five-leaf cut-off was grounded on: (i) the bimodal distribution in the
frequency of the number of symptomatic leaves among the population of
inoculated grapevines (\cref{figS1}), whereby vines that generally
show less than five symptomatic leaves at 12 weeks after inoculation remain so
in the following weeks, while those that pass that threshold continue to
produce symptomatic leaves, and (ii) the observed correlation between the
acropetal and basipetal movement of Xf along the cane (\cref{figS1}).
The likelihood of developing chronic infections as a function of accumulated
MGDD among the population of grapevine varieties was modelled using survival
analysis with data fitted to a logistic distribution $\mathcal{F}(MGDD)$. A
minimum window of $MGDD=528$ was needed to develop chronic infections (var.
Tempranillo), about 975 for a median estimate, while a cumulative $MGDD>1159$
indicate over 90\% probability within a growing season (red curve in
\cref{fig1}c and Methods).

Next, we intended to model the probability of disease recovery by exposure to
cold temperatures. Previous works had specifically modelled cold curing on
Pinot Noir and Cabernet Sauvignon varieties in California as the effect of
temperature and duration \cite{Lieth2011} by assuming a progressive elimination
of the bacterial load with cold temperatures \cite{Feil2003}. In the absence of
appropriate empirical data to formulate a general average pattern of winter
curing among grapevine varieties, we combined the approach of Lieth et al.
\cite{Lieth2011} and the empirical observations of Purcell on the distribution
of PD in the US related to the average minimum temperature of the coldest
month, $T_{min}$, isolines \cite{Anas2008}. To consider
the accumulation of cold units in an analogy of the MGDD, we searched for a
general correlation between $T_{min}$ and the cold degree days (CDDs) with base
temperature = $6$ \textdegree C (see Methods). We found an exponential
relation, $CDD \sim 230\exp(-0.26\cdot T_{\textrm{min}})$, where specifically,
$CDD\gtrsim306$ correspond to $T_{\textrm{min}}<\SI{-1.1}{\degree C}$
(\cref{fig1}b). To transform this exponential relationship to a probabilistic
function analogous to $\mathcal{F}(MGDD)$, hereafter denoted
$\mathcal{G}(CDD)$, ranging between 0 and 1, we considered the sigmoidal family
of functions $\displaystyle f(x)=\frac{A}{B+x^C}$ with $A=9\cdot 10^6$, $B=A$
and $C=3$ (\cref{fig1}c), fulfilling the limit $\mathcal{G}(CDD=0)=1$, i.e. no
winter curing when no cold accumulated, and a conservative 75\% of the infected
plants recovered at $T_{\textrm{min}}=\SI{-1.1}{\degree C}$ instead of 100\% to
reflect uncertainties on the effect of winter curing.

\subsection{MGDD/CDD distribution maps}

MGDD were used to compute annual risk
maps of developing PD during summer for the period 1981-2019 (see Methods).
The resulting averaged map identifies all known areas with a recent history of
severe PD in the US corresponding to $\mathcal{F}(MGDD) > 90\%$ (i.e.,
high-risk), such as the Gulf Coast states (Texas, Alabama, Mississippi,
Louisiana, Florida), Georgia and Southern California sites (e.g., Temecula
Valley) (\cref{fig2}a), while captures areas with a steep gradation of
disease endemicity in the north coast of California ($\mathcal{F}(MGDD>50\%$)).
    Overall, more than $95\%$ of confirmed PD sites ($n = 155$) in the US
    fall in grid cells with $\mathcal{F}(MGDD) > 50 \%$.
    The average MGDD-projected map for Europe during 1981-2019 spots a high
    risk for the coast, islands and major river valleys of the Mediterranean
    Basin, southern Spain, the Atlantic coast from Gibraltar to Oporto, and
    continental areas of central and southeast Europe (\cref{fig2}b). Of these,
    however, only some Mediterranean islands, such as Cyprus and Crete, show
$\mathcal{F}(MGDD) > 99\%$ comparable to areas with high disease incidence in
    the Gulf Coast states of the US and California. Almost all the Atlantic
    coast from Oporto (Portugal) to Denmark are below suitable $MGDD$, with an
    important exception in the Garonne river basin in France (Bordeaux Area)
    with low to moderate $MGDD$ (\cref{fig2}b).

    \cref{fig2}a shows how the area with high-risk MGDD values extends further
    north of the current known PD distribution in the southeastern US,
    suggesting
    that winter temperatures limit the expansion of PD northwards
    \cite{Hopkins2002}. A comparison between MGDD and CDD maps (\cref{fig2}a
    vs.
    \cref{fig2}c, \cref{fig2}e) further supports the idea that winter curing is
    restricting PD northward migration from the southeastern US. However,
    consistent with growing concern among Midwest states winegrowers on PD
    northward migration led by climate change \cite{Galvez2010}, we found a
    mean
    increase of $0.12 \%$ y$^{-1}$ in the areal extent with $CDD < 306$ ($\sim
T_{\textrm{min}} < -1.1$ \textdegree C) since 1981, comprising land areas
    between $103^o$W and $70^o$W of the US (\cref{fig:sup_CDD_evol}). Such an
    upward
    trend corresponds to $\SI{5090}{km^2}$ y$^{-1}$ in the potential northward
    expansion of PD due to climate change and an accumulation of $\sim
\SI{193420}{km^2}$ of new areas at risk since 1981.

    High-CDD values would also be expected to restrict the potential PD
    colonisation in continental Europe (\cref{fig2}d). Unlike North America,
    the
    East-West distribution of major European mountain ranges together with the
    warming effect of the Gulf Stream decreases the likelihood of cold winter
    spells reaching the western Mediterranean coast. $\mathcal{G}(CDD)$ between
    100\% and 95\% (i.e., recovery probability $<5\%$ -- low winter curing) are
    mostly prevalent below $40^o$N latitude in the southwest Iberian Peninsula
    and
    Mediterranean islands and coastlands ($<\SI{50}{km}$ away). Above $40^o$N
    latitudes, $CDD < 100$ are encountered mainly in the Atlantic coast and
    Mediterranean coast and islands (\cref{fig2}d). In contrast, central and
    southeast Europe show high CDD values likely preventing Xf$_{\textrm{PD}}$
    winter survival on infected grapevines.

    In \cref{fig2}e-f, we show the average climatic suitability for PD
    establishment only from the mechanistic relation between Xf$_{\textrm{PD}}$
    and
    temperature. Although all areas with current Xf$_{\textrm{PD}}$-related
    outbreaks are identified, risk predictions based only on the combination of
    MGDD and CDD could lead to overestimations, as this approach overlooks
    disease
    transmission dynamics and climate interannual variability.

            be observed

    \subsection{PD global risk}
    We ran several simulations of the model \cref{eq:evolution_eq} with $R_0$
    values between 1 and 14 to validate PD spatiotemporal distribution in the
    US. We found $R_0=8$ as the optimal parameter for maximising the area under
    a ROC curve (\cref{fig:sup_ROC}), returning an accuracy of more than
$80\%$, except for 2006, due to data obtained from an area at the
    transient-risk zone (\cref{fig:sup_validation} and \cref{tab:validation}).
    For Europe and the rest of the world, we derived a $R_0=5$, as a maximal
    baseline estimate for modelling PD transmission (see Methods and
    \cref{app:R0_Europe}). These $R_0$ values should be taken as operating
    estimates for the model.  From the model simulations
    \cref{eq:evolution_eq}, we obtained a risk index $r$ that measures the
    relative exponential growth rate in the population of infected plants
    at the epidemic onset with respect to the maximum growth, $r=1$. This index
    served to rank the epidemic-risk zones in high ($> 0.9$), moderate
    ($0.66-0.9$), low ($0.33-0.66$) and very low ($\sim 0.075-0.33$) risks (see
    \cref{fig1}f, Methods, and \cref{app:risk_index}).

    To date, PD is mainly restricted to the American continent with some
    unrelated introductions of Xf$_{\textrm{PD}}$ to Taiwan and Majorca (Spain)
    from the United States \cite{Moralejo2019,Su2013}. To assess the risk of PD
    establishment elsewhere, we projected our epidemiological model into the
    main winegrowing regions of the Northern Hemisphere (US, Europe and China)
    and Southern Hemisphere (Chile, Argentina, South Africa, Australia and New
    Zealand)(\cref{fig3}a-e). We found that emerging wine-producing areas in
    China are predominantly located in non-risk zones, whereas only some
    vineyards in the Henan and Yunnan provinces fall in transition and
    moderate-high risk zones (\cref{fig3}b). In Europe, 92.1\% of the territory
    is in non-risk zones and 6.1\% is included in the epidemic-risk zone, with
    only 1.9\% showing a high-risk index and 1.5\% a moderate risk
    (\cref{tableS2}). The model also reveals a progressive transition from
    areas without risk ($r(t) < 0$) before 1990 to
    epidemic-risk zones with low-risk indexes by 2019 (\cite{Webpage}, see
    Movies), mainly affecting the basins of the rivers Po in Italy, Garonne and
    Rhone in France and Douro/Duero in Portugal and Spain. This represents a
    mean increase of $0.21\%$ y$^{-1}$ in the epidemic-risk zone, a rate
$3.5$-times greater than that of the eastern US, which could increase the
    likelihood of PD establishment in Europe in the coming decades. In the US,
    most states around the Gulf Coast show high-risk indexes, whereas, around
    37.5\% of California's surface is suitable for epidemics with high growth
    rate incidence (\cref{tableS3}).

    In the Southern Hemisphere, vineyards at non-risk or transient
    epidemic-risk
    zones predominate -- e.g., non-risk in New Zealand and Tasmania
    (\cref{fig3}c).
    Risk indexes in areas where PD can become established ($r(t) > 0$) range
    from
    very low to low for most coastal vineyards in Australia (west, south and
    east)
    with somehow more suitable conditions in the interior of New South Wales,
    Greater Perth and Queensland (\cref{fig3}c); a general very-low or low-risk
    indexes are predicted in the Western Cape in South Africa (\cref{fig3}d);
    overall very-low but localised low to moderate risk indexes in some areas
    in
    Chile; and low to moderate growth of the number of infected vines in most
    of
    Argentina, being this the wine-growing country with the highest risk
    (\cref{fig3}a). Detailed information on areas with non-risk, transient risk
    and
    risk indexes (i.e., disease-incidence growth rates) in areas with the
    potential
    risk of establishment by country and regions is provided in \cref{tableS4}.

    Risk indexes may vary within epidemic-risk zones if any of the
    epidemiological parameters governing transmission change. As expected,
$I(t) < I(0)$ boundaries increasingly displace to northern latitudes in the US
    and Europe under higher transmission scenarios, increasing the
    risk-epidemic zones significantly (\cref{fig4}a-f). The line representing
    the outbreak extinction i.e., the non-risk zone $r(t)<-0.09$, in the
    validated $R_0=8$ scenario for the US, falls at some distance above the
    isoline $T_{\textrm{min}} = -1.1^o$C in comparison to the $R_0=5$ scenario
    (\cref{fig4}c vs \cref{fig4}a and \cite{Webpage}, Movies). This
    distribution pattern holds and moves slightly northward over time in
    parallel to global warming, although the trend of PD latitudinal change is
    moderated by high-CDD values (i.e. cold accumulation). In addition, the
    disease extension also declines due to CDD interannual fluctuations in the
    simulations. Cold waves periodically occur that reach latitudes close to
    the Gulf, such as those that occurred in 1983, 1993, 1995, 2000, 2009 and
    2013 (Movies at \cite{Webpage}), thus preventing PD expansion northward.
    The magnitude of this decrease is revealed after comparing the average
    annual increase of the areas between $r(t) > 0$ and $CDD < 306$ lines. From
    1981 to 2019, the area with risk $r(t) > 0$ increased at a rate of $0.05\%$
    y$^{-1}$, while that of $CDD < 306$ by $0.12\%$ y$^{-1}$, an important
    difference not explained alone by CDDs without considering climate
    fluctuations (\cref{fig:sup_CDD_evol}).

    We checked whether using a beta function produces changes in the risk
    indexes
    with respect to the Arrhenius-based approach. Firstly, we needed to
    calibrate
    the model using the probability of developing chronic infections, as in
    Fig.
    1C, with the values of MGDD obtained with the beta function. We found
    little
    differences, mainly a decrease in risk index in the transition zones
    between
    risk and non-risk zones (\cref{fig:R2,fig:R3}), and non-significant
    differences in risk zones at the global scale.

    \subsection{PD risk projections for 2050}

    Global shifts in the risk index $r_j(t)$ between 2019 and those projected
    for 2050 were calculated under the same baseline scenario (\cref{fig5}a-f,
    Methods). Our simulation shows a generalised increasing trend mainly due to
    shifts from transition zones to epidemic-risk zones with very low or
    low-risk indexes in the main wine-growing regions, except for the US. Here
    the epidemic-risk zone would increase by $12.8\%$ with the greater
    increments in the high-risk index category ($22.7\%$) and a decrease in the
    transition zones (\cref{tableS5}). Much less surface would be
    included in the epidemic-risk zone in Europe ($8.6\%$) compared to the US
    ($36.5\%$). However, the epidemic-risk zone would expand by $40.0\%$ with
    respect to 2020, a rate more than three times higher than
    that of the US (\cref{tableS6}). Such increases are due to the
    emergence of previously unaffected areas in 2020 evolving into
    epidemic-risk zones by 2050, and epidemic growth-rate increases in already
    epidemic-risk zones in 12 of 42 countries (\cref{tableS2}). Among
    these 12 countries, however, there is substantial variation in the risk
    index increments within epidemic-risk zones with respect to 2019
    (\cref{tableS6}). While non-risk zones still cover $87.6\%$ of
    Europe's land area, epidemic-risk zones with high-risk indexes are expected
    to be almost two-fold higher than that of 2019, comprising $3.2\%$ of
    Europe (\cref{table2}).

    \subsection{Risk based on vector information}

    So far, we have ignored the distribution of known and potential vector
    species due to their large number in the Americas and the limited
    quantitative information generally available. In the case of Europe, given
    \textit{P. spumarius} prevalence as a potential
    vector and its wide distribution, we added	a vector layer in a spatially
    dependent $R_0(j) = R_0^{\textrm{max}}\, v(j)$, where $v(j)$ is the
    climatic
    suitability for the vector (Methods), $v=1$ implies optimal climatic
    conditions
    with no constraints for the vector population size, while $v=0$ implies
    unsuitable climatic conditions and its absence (\cref{fig:sup_vector}).
    According to the model, no European zone shows a high-risk index and barely
$0.34\%$ of the territory falls in areas with potential moderate exponential
    growth rates in disease incidence (\cref{tableS7}). Irrespective of
    vineyard distribution, we estimated that PD could potentially become
    established (i.e., $r(t) > 0$) at a maximum of $3.1\%$ of the territory,
    while the area at moderate-risk index would be $5$-times lesser than the
    model without the vector's climate suitability layer, this latter more in
    consonance with other proposed risk maps \cite{Godefroid2019,Bragard2019}.
    Such differences in the projected risks are mainly concentrated in the
    warmest and driest Mediterranean regions and are due to uncertainties
    concerning temperature-humidity interactions in the ecology of the vector
    \cite{Godefroid2021}.

    \subsection{Combining vineyard land cover across Europe with the model
        output}
    When we integrate into the model a layer of vineyard surface from
    Corine-Land-Cover, we find that PD could potentially become established
    (i.e.,
$r(t)>0.075$) in $22.3\%$ of the vineyards in Europe. However, no vineyard is
    in epidemic-risk zones with a high-risk index and only $2.9\%$ of the
    vineyard surface is at moderate risk (\cref{tableS8}). The areas with the
    highest risk index ($r(t)$ between $0.70$ and $0.88$) are mainly located in
    the Mediterranean islands of Crete, Cyprus and the Balearic Islands or at
    pronounced peninsulas like Apulia (Italy) and Peloponnese (Greece) in the
    continent (\cref{fig6}a and \cref{tableS8}).  Most vineyards are in
    non-risk zones ($42.1\%$), whereas $35.6\%$ are located in transition zones
    with presently non-risk but where Xf$_{\textrm{PD}}$ could become
    established in the next decades causing some sporadic outbreaks. In
    \cref{tableS4,tableS8}, we provide full details of the total vineyard
    areas currently at risk for each country and region.

            dryer.}
        \label{fig6}
    \end{figure}

    Our model with climate and vector distribution projections for 2050
    indicates a $ 55.8 \% $ increase in the epidemic-risk zone in Europe
    (\cref{fig6}b). This increment would be mainly due to the extension of
    epidemic-risk zones with very low and low-risk indexes. However, within the
    epidemic-risk zones, areas with moderate risk indexes would decrease from
$\SI{114925}{ha}$ in 2020 to $\SI{43114}{ha}$ in 2050, and no vineyards would
    be at high risk (\cref{fig6}b; see \cref{tableS9}). Counterintuitively,
    our model indicates a substantial increase in the area where PD could
    establish and become endemic for 2050, but a moderate decline in those
    areas where crop damage could be expected to be significant (e.g., Balearic
    Islands, Crete, Cyprus, Apulia).

    \section{Discussion}

    We introduce an epidemiological approach to assess the risk of PD
    establishment and epidemics in vineyards worldwide. The model includes the
    dynamics of the infected-host population, which enables estimating the
    initial exponential growth/decrease rate of the disease incidence. Unlike
    SDM correlative studies, Bayesian or, in general, machine learning
    black-box approaches, our model goes beyond by providing a mechanistic
    framework and thus explanatory power. In addition, it is flexible enough to
    simulate different climate and transmission scenarios, allowing, for
    instance, the incorporation of information on the spatial distribution of
    the vector. Comprehensive global PD risk maps result from the model
    simulations with historical climatic data. A web page is included, showing
    simulations with different parameters to estimate the risk of PD anywhere
    \cite{Webpage}.

    Temperature regulates key physiological processes of the ectothermic
    organisms involved in PD and thus limits the thermal range in which they
    can thrive \cite{Coakley1999}. Xf$_{\textrm{PD}}$ multiplication and
    survival within vine xylem vessels not only characterise PD, but also
    determine the bacterial population dynamics
    \cite{fry1990multiplication,Feil2001}. PD symptom development can be
    therefore characterised as a thermal-dependent continuous process within
    the range of  Xf$_{\textrm{PD}}$'s cardinal temperatures \cite{Scherm1994}.
    The combination of MGDD metrics with robust experimental data provides a
    reliable predictor of climatic suitability and the probability of
    developing PD during the summer, whereas CDD accounts for the effect of
    cold-temperature exposure on infected-plant recovery. This opposite
    contribution of MGDD and CDD in the demography of infected plants shapes
    the impact of climate variability on the epidemic dynamics in the early
    stages of the invasion (\cref{fig1}d). Given that the physiological basis
    of the plant-Xf interaction leading to symptoms development is poorly
    understood, we caution that other environmental factors, such as drought,
    nutrient status or crop management may modulate symptom expression and
    hence add an error in the MGDD parameter not measured in this work.
    Nonetheless, we deem the error range would be smaller than the differences
    in the accumulated $MGDD$s needed to reach the same disease level among
    varieties (i.e., regional differences) and smaller than the interannual
$MGDD$ oscillations found in most locations. In addition, our model is general
    enough to allow for other functions or adjustments of the relationship
    between Xf$_{\textrm{PD}}$'s growth rate and temperature in vitro
    as better experimental data become available. However, we deem that the
    differences in the risk indices would vary very little in risk zones, as we
    observe in PD risk maps for Europe when a Beta function is applied instead
    of the Arrhenius-based approach to adjust the MGDD (\cref{fig:R2,fig:R3}).

    Knowledge of insect distribution is crucial for predicting epidemic
    outbreaks of endemic diseases, as well as the risk of invasion by emerging
    vector-borne pathogens (\cite {Caminade2017,Jeger2019}, (cf.
    \cite{Schneider2020})). Given the great diversity of known and potential
    vectors that can transmit PD \cite{Redak2004}, it has not been possible to
    include each region's particular vectors in the model. Therefore, when
    evaluating the risk of PD on a global scale, we have considered a
    homogeneous spatial distribution of the vector (fixed $ R_0 $), except in
    Europe where there is information on the main vector
    (\cref{fig:sup_vector}). As expected, the European case shows how models
    that assume a homogeneous spatial distribution of the vector generally
    produce epidemic risk zones with higher risk indexes than models that
    include a heterogeneous spatial distribution (\cref{tableS2} vs.
    \cref{tableS7}). This lack of information about vectors is one of the main
    reasons why the risk of vector-borne plant diseases is often overestimated.

    Risk overestimations may involuntarily stem from other additional sources
    too. Using mean data as inputs in epidemiological models can lead to biased
    results when response functions are nonlinear and climate variability is
    not accounted for \cite{Scherm1994}. This study presents experimental
    evidence of a non-linear relationship between MGDDs and PD chronic
    infections and indirect empirical evidence of a non-linear relationship
    between CDDs and PD recovery (\cref{fig:sup_climatic_oscilations}). Such a
    non-linear response consequently greatly impacts reducing the risk of PD
    establishment and steeping the spatial gradients in risk maps
    (\cref{fig4,fig6}). Moreover, MGDDs and CDDs might help to explain why
    disease pressure is much higher in the southeastern US than in California
    and Europe (\cref{fig2,fig4}) or, for example, earlier reports of PD
    outbreaks in Kosovo  \cite{Berisha1998}. Cooler summer nights in California
    and a shorter growing season compared to those found in the Gulf states in
    the southeastern US explain the difference in the accumulated $MGDD$ for
    both areas. In the case of Kosovo, $CDD$ values above certain thresholds
    could have led to the extinction of incipient outbreaks driven by several
    years with $MGDD$ in the conducive range of PD (\cref{fig2}).

    Our PD risk map for Europe confirms previous predictions for the subsp.
    \textit{fastidiosa} from SDMs \cite{Bragard2019}. Both approaches make
    congruent predictions on PD potential distribution, providing convergent
    lines
    of independent evidence of climate suitability. However, our risk maps go
    further by incorporating in the epidemic-risk zones information on the
    relative
    exponential growth rates in the potential disease incidence. In general
    terms,
    the epidemic-risk map including vector information indicates a low risk for
    chronic PD. Only $\sim 0.34\%$ of European vineyard surface, mainly located
    in
    Cyprus, Crete, Sardinia, part of Sicily and the Balearic Islands, meet
    climatic
    conditions for PD to become endemic and cause significant damage
    (\cref{tableS7}). Other regions such as Bordeaux,
    Portugal,
    Rh\^one Valley, and the Veneto region, would be included in epidemic-risk
    zones
    but with very low to low exponential growth rates in disease incidence. By
    contrast, notorious wine-growing regions in Spain (e.g., Rioja, Ribera del
    Duero), France (e.g., Burgundy) and Italy (e.g., Piedmont) currently fall
    within areas considered as non-risk zones, transient-epidemic zones or
    epidemic-risk zones with very-low risk indexes (\cref{fig6}).

    The dynamic nature of the simulation outputs already points to a
    progressive
    global increase in the areal extension of PD epidemic-risk zones ($r(t)>0$)
    in
    the last decade, irrespective of vineyard distribution (see movies on
    \cite{Webpage}). This is even more accentuated in the model projections for
    2050, which point out a global expansion of PD epidemic-risk zones at
    different
    velocities among continents due to climate change (\cref{fig5}). For
    example,
    many important viticulture areas in western Europe included in non-risk or
    transition zones before 1990 are progressively shifting to hotter summers
    and
    milder winters and hence would be increasingly suitable for the disease
    within
    the extrapolated current scenario. This is further illustrated by a $40\%$
    increase of the potential epidemic-risk zone by 2050 concerning 2020 for
    Europe
    and more moderate increases in the United States and the Southern
    Hemisphere
    (\cref{fig5}). Nonetheless, our model projection for 2050 that includes
    spatial
    heterogeneity in the vector distribution, as in Europe, would indicate
    lower
    transmissibility because global change is predicted to have negative
    effects on
    \textit{P. spumarius} abundance in Europe \cite{Godefroid2021,Karban2018}.
    At
    the global scale, there is certainly scientific consensus that climate
    change
    will follow a general pattern summarised in the paradigm "dry gets drier,
    wet
    gets wetter" \cite{Feng2015}. In agreement, our model projection for PD on
    the
    vineyards of Majorca (Spain) suggests shifts to slightly less favourable
    conditions for Xf$_{\textrm{PD}}$ transmission and an expected progressive
    decrease in the impact of the disease by 2050. This example and others in
    Mediterranean islands advocate for certain
    caution
    when interpreting climate change projections, especially in other
    Mediterranean
    climates of the world, where the complex interactions between humidity and
    temperature can limit the presence and abundance of vectors
    (\cref{fig:sup_vector}).

    The scope of our study excludes location-specific complexities surrounding
    PD
    ecology due to scale limitations. The spatial distribution of the vector is
    considered only for the \textit{V. vinifera}-Xf$_{\textrm{PD}}$-{\textit{P.
        spumarius}} pathosystem in Europe, so $R_0$ estimations could locally
    differ in
    other wine-producing regions elsewhere (\cref{fig3}). Disease incidence
    thus
    could locally vary where the climate is conducive to PD. Such variation is
    because transmission rates tend to increase exponentially rather than
    linearly
    under environmental conditions favouring vector abundance
    \cite{Gruber2012}, as
    has been observed at a local scale on vineyards of Majorca
    \cite{Moralejo2019}.
    Our study also does not contemplate likely changes within the PD
    pathosystem.
    To date, PD is caused by Xf$_{\textrm{PD}}$ (i.e., ST1/ST2), but other
    genotypes of the subsp. \textit{fastidiosa} or other subspecies and their
    recombinations could arise in the future with different ecological and
    virulence traits \cite{Vanhove2019}. On the other hand, new vector species
    could be accidentally brought in \cite{Redak2004}, as exemplified with the
    introduction of the glassy-winged sharpshooter (\textit{Homalodisca
        vitripennis}) in California, modifying transmission rates and disease
    incidence
    in new areas \cite{Daugherty2019}. To capture these uncertainties in
    relation
    to the vector, we have performed simulations with $R_0 = 8$ and $R_0 = 16$
    (\cref{fig4}). Remarkably, a comparison of PD risk maps for Europe with
    different $R_0$ suggests for non-Mediterranean areas the need to stress
    more
    surveillance on the introduction of alien vectors rather than in the
    pathogen
    itself. This is because, under the current scenario ($R_0$ = 5) with
    \textit{P.
        spumarius} as the main vector, most of the non-Mediterranean vineyards
    would
    not support the establishment of PD, but the introduction of new insect
    vectors
    with greater transmission efficiency ($R_0=8$) could compensate for the
    climatic layer and increase the risk index above 0. In addition,
    differences in
    grapevine varietal response alongside virulence variation among Xf strains
    may
    slightly modify PD thermal tolerance limits and therefore locally modulate
    epidemic intensity (see details in \cref{app:PD_risk}). Such an
    effect
    could be seen with cv. Tempranillo, a widely planted variety in northern
    Spain
    (\cref{tableS1}); the rate of symptom progress and systemic
    movement is
    higher than the average varietal response to Xf$_{\textrm{PD}}$ (i.e.,
    lower
$MGDD$), which in addition might imply higher survival rates. This point calls
    for further testing in the field.

    Our model partially explains why PD has not become established in
    continental
    Europe and other main wine-growing regions worldwide during the last 150
    years,
    in contrast to other exotic diseases and pests brought in with native vines
    from the US \cite{Borkarbook, Brewer2010, Rouxel2014, Tello2019}. We
    suggest
    that the underlying causes of this low-invasiveness risk in Europe are
    fundamentally two: (i) low climatic suitability for chronic PD and (ii) a
    climatic mismatch between environment conditions suitable for both the
    vector
    and the pathogen and their interplay in disease dynamics, similar to the
    situation recently described for the \textit{V.
        vinifera}-Xf$_{\textrm{PD}}$-{\textit{P. spumarius}} pathosystem in
northern
California \cite{Beal2021}. Currently, suitable conditions for the
pathogen's
invasion mostly concur in Mediterranean islands and coastlands. Likewise,
similar results would be expected in other Mediterranean
climates of the main winegrowing regions of the Southern Hemisphere if a
vector
spatial distribution layer is incorporated in the model simulations (see
\cite{Webpage}). Finally, although increasing global warming will extend
epidemic-risk zones in all continents, some caution is recommended to not
incur
risk overestimation, as we show in the PD risk projections for 2050 in
Europe
when taking into account the vector spatial distribution; complex
interactions
between temperature and humidity in the ecology of the vectors may have a
great
effect in their distribution, abundance and thus transmission capacity
\cite{Godefroid2021}. There is an urgent need to fill the knowledge gap on
the
ecophysiology for each potential vector to downscale PD model predictions
to
local and regional situations.
