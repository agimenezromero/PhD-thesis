% Things that remain unexplored/unknown:

% 1. Spatial effects of SIRP model are different when applying a PDE than
% an IBM. We should be able to model the SIRP model with a PDE and obtain
% the same results as the IBM, but the form of the PDE is not yet clear.

% 2. Models of vector-borne diseases with growing and decaying populations
% seem to produce epidemic outbreaks in a different way than usual epidemic
% models. This is an interesting area of research that has not been explored
% in this thesis.

% 3. There is yet not an explanation for the macroecological patterns
% observed for coral reefs. This is an interesting area of research that
% has not been explored in this thesis.
