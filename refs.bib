  abstract   = {(1) One of the most striking features in the study of epidemics is the difficulty of finding a causal factor which appears to be adequate to account for the magnitude of the frequent epidemics of disease which visit almost every population. It was with a view to obtaining more insight regarding the effects of the various factors which govern the spread of contagious epidemics that the present investigation was undertaken. Reference may here be made to the work of Ross and Hudson (1915-17) in which the same problem is attacked. The problem is here carried to a further stage, and it is considered from a point of view which is in one sense more general. The problem may be summarised as follows: One (or more) infected person is introduced into a community of individuals, more or less susceptible to the disease in question. The disease spreads from the affected to the unaffected by contact infection. Each infected person runs through the course of his sickness, and finally is removed from the number of those who are sick, by recovery or by death. The chances of recovery or death vary from day to day during the course of his illness. The chances that the affected may convey infection to the unaffected are likewise dependent upon the stage of the sickness. As the epidemic spreads, the number of unaffected members of the community becomes reduced. Since the course of an epidemic is short compared with the life of an individual, the population may be considered as remaining constant, except in as far as it is modified by deaths due to the epidemic disease itself. In the course of time the epidemic may come to an end. One of the most important probems in epidemiology is to ascertain whether this termination occurs only when no susceptible individuals are left, or whether the interplay of the various factors of infectivity, recovery and mortality, may result in termination, whilst many susceptible individuals are still present in the unaffected population. It is difficult to treat this problem in its most general aspect. In the present communication discussion will be limited to the case in which all members of the community are initially equally susceptible to the disease, and it will be further assumed that complete immunity is conferred by a single infection.},

  abstract   = {In a previous communication an attempt was made to investigate mathematically the course of an epidemic in a closed population of susceptible individuals. In order to simplify the problem certain definite assumptions were made, namely, that all individuals were equally susceptible, and that death resulted, or complete immunity was conferred, as the result of an attack. The infectivity of the individual and his chances of death or recovery were represented by arbitrary functions, and the chance of a new infection occurring was assumed to be proportional to the product of the infected and susceptible members of the population. In spite of the introduction of the arbitrary functions, it was shown that in general a critical density of population existed, such that if the actual density was less than this, no epidemic could occur, but if it exceeded this by n an epidemic would appear on the introduction of a focus of infection, and further that if n was small relative to the population density, the size of the epidemic would be 2n per unit area. It was shown that these conclusions could be readily extended to the case of a metaxenous disease, that is, one in which transmission takes place through an intermediate host. It is the purpose of the present paper to consider the effect of the continuous introduction of fresh susceptible individuals into the population. It appeared desirable to investigate this point, since it might make it possible to interpret certain aspects of the incidence of disease not only in human communities where there is usually an influx of fresh susceptible individuals either by immigration or by birth, but also in the animal experiments carried out by Topley and others—where fresh animals were introduced at a constant rate into the cages in which cases of disease were already present—from which certain definite results were obtained.}

  abstract = {Summary(1)The mathematical investigation of the progress of an infectious disease in a community of susceptible individuals has been extended to include the case where members of the community are removed as the result of some general cause of death acting according to constant non-specific death rates, as well as by death from the disease itself. Under the more general conditions here dealt with the main conclusions arrived at in the previous paper remain qualitatively unaltered. The limitations which remain are that the susceptibility and the infective power of the individual are supposed to be independent of his age, and further that specific individual immunity does not exist in the sense that the part of the population which escapes infection is assumed to be just as susceptible as the whole population would have been if it had not been infected.(2)In the general case a unique steady state is found to exist provided that certain relatively simple conditions are satisfied. In the special cases considered a unique steady state in general exists when these conditions continue to be satisfied; but in particular instances, when these conditions are not satisfied, unique steady states will exist provided that certain other requirements are fulfilled.(3)Increase of birth rates, in general, increases both the absolute and the relative prevalence of the disease in its steady state. The effect of increase in the non-specific death rates is less simple, but has been worked out at some length.(4)Two types of threshold values have been encountered. In the first type the quantity in question must initially exceed the threshold value if the event or process is to occur in the population. Two examples of this type have been found, namely, in Cases (4) and (2′d). In the second type the quantity in question need not initially exceed the threshold value, but may gradually change as the system develops. The event or process to which the threshold refers can only take place when the threshold value has been exceeded. The total population density has a threshold value of this second kind with reference to the existence of steady states. Decrease in the infectivity of the disease or in the susceptibility of the uninfected results in an increase in the whole population density as well as in an increase in the number of infected. The effect upon the relative incidence of the disease cannot be simply expressed, but it has been worked out in detail in the text. In the absence of immigration, and with the birth rates and also the non-specific death rates equal for virgins and recovered, variation in infectivity or susceptibility will not alter the relative incidence of the disease. The total population, however, will increase with decrease of either of these two factors, whilst the number of diseased will also increase proportionately.}

  abstract = {Most of epidemiological theory has been developed for terrestrial systems, but the significance of disease in the ocean is now being recognized. However, the extent to which terrestrial epidemiology can be directly transferred to marine systems is uncertain. Many broad types of disease-causing organism occur both on land and in the sea, and it is clear that some emergent disease problems in marine environments are caused by pathogens moving from terrestrial to marine systems. However, marine systems are qualitatively different from terrestrial environments, and these differences affect the application of modelling and management approaches that have been developed for terrestrial systems. Phyla and body plans are more diverse in marine environments and marine organisms have different life histories and probably different disease transmission modes than many of their terrestrial counterparts. Marine populations are typically more open than terrestrial ones, with the potential for long-distance dispersal of larvae. Potentially, this might enable unusually rapid propagation of epidemics in marine systems, and there are several examples of this. Taken together, these differences will require the development of new approaches to modelling and control of infectious disease in the ocean.}

These analyses emphasize the sensitivity of R0 to heterogeneities created by either the spatial structure of the host population, or the ability of the pathogens to utilize multiple host species. At each stage we illustrate how the approach provides insight into the initial dynamics of emergent pathogens such as canine parvovirus, Lyme disease, and West Nile virus in the United States.}

  abstract = {Summary 1 Marine protected areas are increasingly being recommended as an essential component of the management of exploited marine species, but virtually no attention has been given to the influence of parasites. This may be substantial, as a primary effect of marine reserves is to increase the density of an exploited population within the reserve relative to outside the reserve, which may facilitate parasite transmission. 2 We used a simple deterministic model of microparasitic infection in a fishery with a reserve to investigate equilibrium yield and parasite prevalence inside and outside the reserve as a function of three control variables: the proportion of habitat inside the reserve, fishing mortality and the rate of interchange between the stock and the reserve. 3 While our model is generic, we parameterized it with values that may be appropriate to the interaction between abalone and Rickettsia. 4 The presence of a pathogen does not necessarily decrease yield when a reserve is present, particularly if the rate of movement of adult hosts between stock and reserve is low. 5 Synthesis and applications. Pathogens have important implications for the design of marine reserves. Our modelling identifies two key considerations. First, ‘fishing out’ a pathogen by reducing the host population density to a level below the threshold for disease maintenance is a potential management strategy that is made more difficult by establishing a reserve. Secondly, the effect of a highly transmissible pathogen without a reserve is to cause a rapid decline in equilibrium yield for efforts beyond those that produce maximum sustainable yield, making the fishery prone to collapse. Introducing a reserve decreases yield in this case, but makes the fishery much more resistant to collapse.}

In most invertebrates, free circulating cells (hemocytes) are responsible for cell-mediated immunity; when activated, different hemocyte types are capable of phagocytosis, reactive oxygen species and NO production, release of hydrolytic enzymes and antimicrobial peptides. Conservation of the general mechanisms of innate immunity from invertebrates to mammals is useful for the evaluation of the environmental impact of nanoparticles. The mechanisms of innate immunity in two model representatives of aquatic (bivalves) and terrestrial (earthworms) environments are summarized, and data supporting the view that cell-mediated immunity can represent the primary target of nanoparticles in invertebrates are presented. The evaluation of immune parameters in invertebrate models may represent a powerful tool for the rapid screening of the immunomodulatory effects of nanoparticles and may provide a basis for designing environmentally safer nanomaterials.}

  abstract   = {Abstract Disease-causing organisms can have significant impacts on marine species and communities. However, the dynamics that underlie the emergence of disease outbreaks in marine ecosystems still lack the equivalent level of description, conceptual understanding, and modeling context routinely present in the terrestrial systems. Here, we propose a theoretical basis for modeling the transmission of marine infectious diseases (MIDs) developed from simple models of the spread of infectious disease. The models represent the dynamics of a variety of host–pathogen systems including those unique to marine systems where transmission of disease is by contact with waterborne pathogens both directly and through filter-feeding processes. Overall, the analysis of the epizootiological models focused on the most relevant processes that interact to drive the initiation and termination of epizootics. A priori, systems with multi-step disease infections (e.g., infection-death-particle release-filtration-transmission) reduced dependence on individual parameters resulting in inherently slower transmissions rates. This is demonstrably not the case; thus, these alternative transmission pathways must also considerably increase the rates of processes involved in transmission. Scavengers removing dead infected animals may inhibit disease spread in both contact-based and waterborne pathogen-based diseases. The capacity of highly infected animals, both alive and dead, to release a substantial number of infective elements into the water column, making them available to suspension feeders results in such diseases being highly infective with a very small “low-abundance refuge”. In these systems, the body burden of pathogens and the relative importance between the release and the removal rate of pathogens in the host tissue or water column becomes paramount. Two processes are of potential consequence inhibiting epizootics. First, large water volumes above the benthic susceptible populations can function as a sink for pathogens. Second, unlike contact-based disease models in which an increase in the number of susceptible individuals in the population increases the likelihood of transmission and epizootic development, large populations of filter feeders can reduce this likelihood through the overfiltration of infective particles.}

The next-generation matrix (NGM) is the natural basis for the definition and calculation of ℛ0 where finitely many different categories of individuals are recognized. We clear up confusion that has been around in the literature concerning the construction of this matrix, specifically for the most frequently used so-called compartmental models. We present a detailed easy recipe for the construction of the NGM from basic ingredients derived directly from the specifications of the model. We show that two related matrices exist which we define to be the NGM with large domain and the NGM with small domain. The three matrices together reflect the range of possibilities encountered in the literature for the characterization of ℛ0. We show how they are connected and how their construction follows from the basic model ingredients, and establish that they have the same non-zero eigenvalues, the largest of which is the basic reproduction number ℛ0. Although we present formal recipes based on linear algebra, we encourage the construction of the NGM by way of direct epidemiological reasoning, using the clear interpretation of the elements of the NGM and of the model ingredients. We present a selection of examples as a practical guide to our methods. In the appendix we present an elementary but complete proof that ℛ0 defined as the dominant eigenvalue of the NGM for compartmental systems and the Malthusian parameter r, the real-time exponential growth rate in the early phase of an outbreak, are connected by the properties that ℛ0 \&gt; 1 if and only if r \&gt; 0, and ℛ0 = 1 if and only if r = 0.}

A newly described Haplosporidian endoparasite (Haplosporidium pinnae) is the most probable cause of this ecological catastrophe placing one of the largest bivalves of the world on the brink of extinction. As a pivotal step towards Pinna nobilis conservation, this contribution combines scientists and citizens' data to address the fast- and vast-dispersion and prevalence outbreaks of the pathogen. Therefore, the potential role of currents on parasite expansion was addressed by means of drift simulations of virtual particles in a high-resolution regional currents model. A generalized additive model was implemented to test if environmental factors could modulate the infection of Pinna nobilis populations. The results strongly suggest that the parasite has probably dispersed regionally by surface currents, and that the disease expression seems to be closely related to temperatures above 13.5{\thinspace}{\textdegree}C and to a salinity range between 36.5--39.7 psu. The most likely spread of the disease along the Mediterranean basin associated with scattered survival spots and very few survivors (potentially resistant individuals), point to a challenging scenario for conservation of the emblematic Pinna nobilis, which will require fast and strategic management measures and should make use of the essential role citizen science projects can play.},

The Mediterranean Sea is considered a laboratory to examine global processes, and the fan mussel Pinna nobilis a sentinel species within it. Since September 2016, fan mussels suffer a die-off, very likely provoked by the protozoan Haplosporidium pinnae. Population dynamic surveys, rescue programmes, larvae collector installation and protection of infected adults from predators, have increased knowledge about the factors conditioning the spread of the die-off; previous model simulations indicate that water temperature and salinity seem to be related to the manifestation of the disease, which at the end are strongly influenced by climate change and anthropogenic actions. The absence of natural recruitment implies that fan mussel populations are not recovering, but the survival of populations living in paralic environments provides an opportunity to study the disease and its conditioning factors. The fan mussel disease outbreak provides a case example for how climate change may mediate host-protozoan dynamics and poses several questions: are we witnessing the potential extinction of a sentinel species? Can we avoid it by applying active measures? If so, which measures will be more effective? How many other more overlooked species might experience a massive and unnoticed die-off before it is too late to implement any preservation action? This is especially relevant because the loss of keystone species can drive to community effects that influence marine ecosystem processes.}

The parasite was found in dead or moribund P. nobilis but did not occur in healthy fan mussels from locations that were not affected by abnormal mortality. Histological examination of infected fan mussels showed uninucleate cells of a haplosporidan parasite throughout the connective tissue and hemolymph sinuses of the visceral mass and binucleate cells and, rarely, multinucleate plasmodia were also detected in the connective tissue. Additionally, stages of sporulation occurred in the epithelium of the host digestive gland tubules. Spores were slightly ellipsoidal with a hinged operculum in one pole. Typical haplosporosomes were not found with TEM but vesicles with two concentric membranes resembling haplosporosomes were abundant in the cytoplasm of the multinucleate plasmodia occurring in host digestive gland tubules. SEM analysis showed multiple structures on the spore surface; some spores had two or four long tape-like filaments attached to the spore wall. Phylogenetic analysis based on the SSU rDNA sequence placed this parasite within a large clade including species of the order Haplosporida, not in the Bonamia/Minchinia subclade or the subclade containing most Haplosporidium species, but within a subclade of Haplosporidium sp. from Penaeus vannamei. Our results suggested that H. pinnae and the parasite of P. vannamei may represent a distinct new genus within the order Haplosporida.}

  abstract = {Ecology Letters (2011) 14: 816–827 Abstract Statistical models are the traditional choice to test scientific theories when observations, processes or boundary conditions are subject to stochasticity. Many important systems in ecology and biology, however, are difficult to capture with statistical models. Stochastic simulation models offer an alternative, but they were hitherto associated with a major disadvantage: their likelihood functions can usually not be calculated explicitly, and thus it is difficult to couple them to well-established statistical theory such as maximum likelihood and Bayesian statistics. A number of new methods, among them Approximate Bayesian Computing and Pattern-Oriented Modelling, bypass this limitation. These methods share three main principles: aggregation of simulated and observed data via summary statistics, likelihood approximation based on the summary statistics, and efficient sampling. We discuss principles as well as advantages and caveats of these methods, and demonstrate their potential for integrating stochastic simulation models into a unified framework for statistical modelling.}

There is evidence for impacts of climate change on marine Mediterranean organisms but a quantitative assessment is lacking. We compiled the impacts of warming reported in the literature to provide a quantitative assessment for the Mediterranean Sea. During the last three decades the summer surface temperature has increased 1.15°C. Strong heat wave events have occurred in years 1994, 2003, and 2009. Impacts of warming are evident on growth, survival, fertility, migration and phenology of pelagic and benthic organisms, from phytoplankton to marine vegetation, invertebrates and vertebrates. Overall, 50\% of biological impacts in the Mediterranean Sea occur at summer surface temperature anomaly ≤ 4.5°C and at summer surface temperature of 27.5°C. The activation energy (geometric mean 1.58 ± 0.48 eV), the slope of the Arrhenius equation describing the temperature-dependence of biological processes, for the response of Mediterranean marine biota to warming reveals that these responses in the Mediterranean are far steepest than possibly explained by the direct effect of warming alone. The observations are biased toward the northern and western sectors of the basin, likely underestimating the impacts of warming in areas where warming is particularly intense.}

  abstract  = {The Mediterranean Sea is a marine biodiversity hot spot. Here we combined an extensive literature analysis with expert opinions to update publicly available estimates of major taxa in this marine ecosystem and to revise and update several species lists. We also assessed overall spatial and temporal patterns of species diversity and identified major changes and threats. Our results listed approximately 17,000 marine species occurring in the Mediterranean Sea. However, our estimates of marine diversity are still incomplete as yet—undescribed species will be added in the future. Diversity for microbes is substantially underestimated, and the deep-sea areas and portions of the southern and eastern region are still poorly known. In addition, the invasion of alien species is a crucial factor that will continue to change the biodiversity of the Mediterranean, mainly in its eastern basin that can spread rapidly northwards and westwards due to the warming of the Mediterranean Sea. Spatial patterns showed a general decrease in biodiversity from northwestern to southeastern regions following a gradient of production, with some exceptions and caution due to gaps in our knowledge of the biota along the southern and eastern rims. Biodiversity was also generally higher in coastal areas and continental shelves, and decreases with depth. Temporal trends indicated that overexploitation and habitat loss have been the main human drivers of historical changes in biodiversity. At present, habitat loss and degradation, followed by fishing impacts, pollution, climate change, eutrophication, and the establishment of alien species are the most important threats and affect the greatest number of taxonomic groups. All these impacts are expected to grow in importance in the future, especially climate change and habitat degradation. The spatial identification of hot spots highlighted the ecological importance of most of the western Mediterranean shelves (and in particular, the Strait of Gibraltar and the adjacent Alboran Sea), western African coast, the Adriatic, and the Aegean Sea, which show high concentrations of endangered, threatened, or vulnerable species. The Levantine Basin, severely impacted by the invasion of species, is endangered as well. This abstract has been translated to other languages (File S1).}

Consequently, many approaches developed to quantify pathogen dispersal in terrestrial ecosystems have limited use in the marine context. Recent applications in marine disease modeling demonstrate that physical oceanographic models coupled with biological models of infectious agents can characterize dispersal networks of pathogens in marine ecosystems. Biophysical modeling has been used over the past two decades to model larval dispersion but has only recently been utilized in marine epidemiology. In this review, we describe how biophysical models function and how they can be used to measure connectivity of infectious agents between sites, test hypotheses regarding pathogen dispersal, and quantify patterns of pathogen spread, focusing on fish and shellfish pathogens.}

  abstract = {Benthic suspension-feeders can accumulate substantial numbers of microparasitic pathogens by contacting or filtering particles while feeding, thus making them highly vulnerable to infectious diseases. The study of disease dynamics in these marine organisms requires an innovative approach to modeling. To do so, we developed a single-population deterministic compartmental model adapted from the mathematical theory of epidemics. The model is a continuous-time model, unstructured in spatial or age terms, and configured to simulate the dynamics of diverse dose (body burden)-dependent infectious disease transmission processes in suspension feeders caused by susceptible individuals contacting or absorbing (filtering) infectious waterborne pathogens. Different scenarios were simulated to explore the effect of recruitment, filtration rate, particle loss, diffusion-like processes in the water column and non-focal hosts (i.e. non-susceptible in terms of disease) on disease incidence. An increase in recruitment (i.e. new disease free susceptibles) can reduce the prevalence of infection due to the dilution effect of adding more susceptibles, but the disease can spread faster for the same reason. Lower infective particle accumulation rates or increasing particle loss rates in the environment reduce the prevalence of infection. This effect is trivial when the water is saturated with infective particles released by infected and/or dead animals. Diffusion of particles from the local pool available to suspension feeders to the adjacent remote pool, prompted by a large remote volume and high particle exchange, limits epizootic development. Similarly, the likelihood of an epizootic can be constrained in a large susceptible population when competition for pathogens, more ‘active’ in active filter feeders than in passive suspension feeders, reduces the per capita infective particle accumulation rate. In passive suspension feeders, decreasing the area of the feeding surface has the same effect in constraining disease development. The effect of competition for infective particles in essence diluting the infective particle concentration in the water column is magnified when the susceptible population is part of a community with non-focal filter feeders, and is particularly effective in limiting disease development in high infective dose systems. At the same time, this active foraging strategy makes filter feeders more vulnerable to epizootics. The model is a suitable framework for studying the disease dynamics and determinants of disease outbreaks in benthic suspension feeders.}

  abstract = {Dermo disease caused by the protistan Perkinsus marinus in Eastern oysters Crassotrea virginica is an important source of mortality impacting oyster population dynamics resulting in substantial losses in fisheries and aquaculture. The rapid transmission and spread of the disease minimized the importance of transmission models and past models (proliferation-based models) assumed simple density-dependent transmission or rapid infection post-settlement. This approach is a good approximation only for low population densities. A transmission model was developed for P. marinus in Eastern oysters that accounts for the seasonal change in disease dynamics and density-dependent foraging (of suspended particles) interference among hosts. The model, verified and evaluated against field observations, incorporates parasite release to the water column from live and dead individuals, parasite consumption by living oysters, the diffusion of parasites in the water, body burden-based dose-dependent transmission, recruitment, and disease-caused mortality. The model returns a basic reproduction number R0 for Dermo much greater than unity (R0=90) in accordance with the current persistence and pandemic nature of this disease in oysters. No population density is obtained that is low enough to suppress R0 below 1 (i.e. disease extinction). R0 is also estimated for high oyster densities (>300 individuals m−2) and particularly for relatively large oysters (∼90mm), today rare but once common before generalized overfishing occurred on healthy oyster reefs. In this scenario, R0 drops below 1, indicating that high oyster density can limit disease invasion through foraging interference and depletion of parasites in the water column. High intensity recruitment events allow the oyster population to attain such densities and limit the development of epizootics. These results provide insight into the transition from past populations, where Dermo is inferred to have been limited in its impact, to the current persistent and pandemic nature of this disease. Further coupling of this model into metapopulation and hydrodynamic models could be a promising tool to support management decision-making for bivalve populations impacted by Dermo disease.}

  abstract = {Disease effects on host population dynamics and the transmission of pathogens between hosts are two important challenges for understanding how epizootics wax and wane and how disease influences host population dynamics. For the management of marine shellfish resources, marine diseases pose additional challenges in early intervention after the appearance of disease, management of the diseased population to limit a decline in host abundance, and application of measures to restrain that decline once it occurs. Mathematical models provide one approach for quantifying these effects and addressing the competing goals of managing the diseased population versus managing the disease. The majority of models for molluscan diseases fall into three categories distinguished by these competing goals. (1) Models that consider disease effects on the host population tend to focus on pathogen proliferation within the host. Many of the well-known molluscan diseases are pandemic, in that they routinely reach high prevalence rapidly over large geographic expanses, are characterized by transmission that does not depend upon a local source, and exert a significant influence on host population dynamics. Models focused on disease proliferation examine the influence of environmental change on host population metrics and provide a basis to better manage diseased stocks. Such models are readily adapted to questions of fishery management and habitat restoration. (2) Transmission models are designed to understand the mechanisms triggering epizootics, identify factors impeding epizootic development, and evaluate controls on the rate of disease spread over the host’s range. Transmission models have been used extensively to study terrestrial diseases, yet little attention has been given to their potential for understanding the epidemiology of marine molluscan diseases. For management of diseases of wild stocks, transmission models open up a range of options, including the application of area management, manipulation of host abundance, and use of scavengers and filter feeders to limit the concentration of infective particles. (3) The details of host population processes and pathogen transmission dynamics are blended in models that evaluate the effects of natural selection and/or genetic modification in developing disease resistance in the host population. Application of gene-based models to marine diseases is only now beginning and represents a promising approach that may provide a mechanistic basis for managing marine diseases and their host populations. Overall disease models remain both uncommon and underutilized in addressing the needs for managing molluscan diseases and their host populations.}

For instance, marine diseases of farmed oysters, shrimp, abalone, and various fishes, particularly Atlantic salmon, cost billions of dollars each year. In comparison, it is often difficult to accurately estimate disease impacts on wild populations, especially those of pelagic and subtidal species. Farmed species often receive infectious diseases from wild species and can, in turn, export infectious agents to wild species. However, the impact of disease export on wild fisheries is controversial because there are few quantitative data demonstrating that wild species near farms suffer more from infectious diseases than those in other areas. The movement of exotic infectious agents to new areas continues to be the greatest concern.},

  abstract        = {Disease outbreaks alter the structure and function of marine ecosystems, directly affecting vertebrates (mammals, turtles, fish), invertebrates (corals, crustaceans, echinoderms), and plants (seagrasses). Previous studies suggest a recent increase in marine disease. However, lack of baseline data in most communities prevents a direct test of this hypothesis. We developed a proxy to evaluate a prediction of the increasing disease hypothesis: the proportion of scientific publications reporting disease increased in recent decades. This represents, to our knowledge, the first quantitative use of normalized trends in the literature to investigate an ecological hypothesis. We searched a literature database for reports of parasites and disease (hereafter “disease”) in nine marine taxonomic groups from 1970 to 2001. Reports, normalized for research effort, increased in turtles, corals, mammals, urchins, and molluscs. No significant trends were detected for seagrasses, decapods, or sharks/rays (though disease occurred in these groups). Counter to the prediction, disease reports decreased in fishes. Formulating effective resource management policy requires understanding the basis and timing of marine disease events. Why disease outbreaks increased in some groups but not in others should be a priority for future investigation. The increase in several groups lends urgency to understanding disease dynamics, particularly since few viable options currently exist to mitigate disease in the oceans.},

(1) Mating and competition for paternity in the sea often differs. Female gametes are often spawned freely. Passively dispersed spermatophores could in some cases provide single paternity to an entire clutch of offspring. Penises of sessile animals reach far for copulation. There are no pollinators. (2) In many clades of benthic marine animals, greater dispersal of offspring is associated with large adult size, and greater parental care of offspring and reduced planktonic larval periods are associated with small adult size. (3) Many benthic marine animals are colonies with modular construction, and these also commonly brood embryos and have short-lived larvae, in contrast to related solitary forms. (4) Unlike dispersal of terrestrial animals, larval dispersal of marine animals is often obligate with sexual reproduction and often includes a precompetent period during which larvae cannot settle at good sites. Unlike terrestrial seeds, marine larvae have no clear adaptations for dispersal, often grow during dispersal, and often leave bad sites. Feeding planktonic larvae are common among marine animals and rare among other aquatic animals, perhaps because of persistent aquatic routes between habitable sites for marine animals. Peculiarities in marine life histories may influence many aspects of evolution in the sea. Closely related sedentary marine animals can differ greatly in larval dispersal with consequences for recruitment to populations, genetic exchange between benthic populations, adaptation to local conditions, sex allocation, interaction with kin, speciation, and extinction. {\textcopyright} 1990 by the American Society of Zoologists.},

Concomitant increases in each of these makes it difficult to attribute recent changes in disease occurrence or severity to any one factor. For example, the increase in disease of Caribbean coral is postulated to be a result of climate change and introduction of terrestrial pathogens. Indirect evidence exists that (a) warming increased disease in turtles; (b) protection, pollution, and terrestrial pathogens increased mammal disease; (c) aquaculture increased disease in mollusks; and (d) release from overfished predators increased sea urchin disease. In contrast, fishing and pollution may have reduced disease in fishes. In other taxa (e.g., sea grasses, crustaceans, sharks), there is little evidence that disease has changed over time. The diversity of patterns suggests there are many ways that environmental change can interact with disease in the ocean.}

Certain generic features of epidemics are well-illustrated by these models, which can be remarkably good at reproducing empirical data through suitably chosen parameters. However, this does not assure a good job anticipating the forthcoming stages of the process. To illustrate this point, we accurately describe the propagation of COVID-19 in Spain using one such model and show that predictions for its subsequent evolution are disparate, even contradictory. The future of ongoing epidemics is so sensitive to parameter values that predictions are only meaningful within a narrow time window and in probabilistic terms, much as what we are used to in weather forecasts.Epidemic spread is characterized by exponentially growing dynamics, which are intrinsically unpredictable. The time at which the growth in the number of infected individuals halts and starts decreasing cannot be calculated with certainty before the turning point is actually attained; neither can the end of the epidemic after the turning point. A susceptible{\textendash}infected{\textendash}removed (SIR) model with confinement (SCIR) illustrates how lockdown measures inhibit infection spread only above a threshold that we calculate. The existence of that threshold has major effects in predictability: A Bayesian fit to the COVID-19 pandemic in Spain shows that a slowdown in the number of newly infected individuals during the expansion phase allows one to infer neither the precise position of the maximum nor whether the measures taken will bring the propagation to the inhibition regime. There is a short horizon for reliable prediction, followed by a dispersion of the possible trajectories that grows extremely fast. The impossibility to predict in the midterm is not due to wrong or incomplete data, since it persists in error-free, synthetically produced datasets and does not necessarily improve by using larger datasets. Our study warns against precise forecasts of the evolution of epidemics based on mean-field, effective, or phenomenological models and supports that only probabilities of different outcomes can be confidently given.We have implemented the Bayesian model in R using the rjags wrapper of the JAGS library (37).

Continuing exploration of haplosporidian diversity has added ten new species in recent years and brought the phylogenetics of the group into somewhat clearer focus, with monophyletic Bonamia and Minchinia lineages continuing to be supported. However, the addition of new sequences to phylogenetic analyses has left the paraphyletic genus Haplosporidium's picture less resolved. It is not clear that even two genera will be enough to accommodate the species presently drawn to the Haplosporidium regions of the haplosporidian tree. In this review, we summarize recent findings in haplosporidian diversity and phylogenetics, and provide a synthesis of our understanding of the life cycles and environmental influences on haplosporidians, with particular emphasis on the important pathogens Haplosporidium nelsoni and Bonamia ostreae. Additionally, we consider the evolution of the “microcell haplosporidian” lifestyle of Bonamia parasites, and suggest that colonization of high-density oyster host populations in relatively stable euhaline marine environments may have been an important development favoring the evolution of the microcell haplosporidian life strategy.},

In 2017--2018, mass mortality events affecting the pen shell Pinna nobilis were recorded in two different regions of Italy, Campania and Sicily, in the Tyrrhenian Sea (Mediterranean Sea). Histopathological and molecular examinations of specimens showed the presence of Haplosporidium sp. in only one specimen in one area. Conversely, in all of the surveyed moribund animals, strong inflammatory lesions at the level of connective tissue surrounding the digestive system and gonads and linked to the presence of intracellular Zhiel-Neelsen-positive bacteria were observed. Molecular analysis of all of the diseased specimens (13) confirmed the presence of a Mycobacterium. Blast analysis of the sequences from all of the areas revealed that they were grouped together with the human mycobacterium M. sherrisii close to the group including M. shigaense, M. lentiflavum and M. simiae. Based on pathological and molecular findings, it is proposed that a mycobacterial disease is associated with the mortality episodes of Pinna nobilis, indicating that, at this time, Haplosporidium sp. is not responsible for these events in Campanian and Sicilian waters.},

Spores were pleomorphic, usually elongated ovoid, with round to elongated haplosporosomes-like in the sporoplasma.

Large-scale positive temperature anomalies already occurred in the northwestern Mediterranean Sea in 1999, 2003 and 2006. These anomalies were associated with mass mortality events of macrobenthic species in coastal areas (0--40 m in depth). The anomalies were particularly severe in 1999 and 2003 when thousands of kilometres of coasts and about 30 species were affected. The aim of this study was to develop a methodology to assess the current risk of mass mortality associated with temperature increase along NW Mediterranean continental coasts. A 3D regional ocean model was used to obtain the temperature conditions for the period 2001--2010, for which the model outputs were validated by comparing them with in situ observations in affected areas. The model was globally satisfactory, although extremes were underestimated and required correction. Combined with information on the thermo-tolerance of a key species (the red gorgonian P. clavata) as well as its spatial distribution, the modelled temperature conditions were then used to assess the risk of mass mortality associated with thermal stress for the first time. Most of the known areas of observed mass mortality were found using the model, although the degree of risk in certain areas was underestimated. Using climatic IPCC scenarios, the methodology could be applied to explore the impacts of expected climate change in the NW Mediterranean. This is a key issue for the development of sound management and conservation plans to protect Mediterranean marine biodiversity in the face of climate change.},

Long-term monitoring was also conducted in Fangar Bay (North Ebro Delta), featuring lower salinities and no evidence of disease. Results showed that the salinity gradient of Alfacs Bay (37.4 to 35.7) was associated to cumulative mortality (100\% near the mouth, 43\% in middle regions, and 13\% in inner regions), thus hindering the spread of pathogens. Young specimens showed to be more tolerant to disease than large adults but become vulnerable over time. In Fangar Bay, lower salinities (30.5 to 33.5) prevented the disease but individuals were highly vulnerable to Storm Gloria which caused 60\% mortality in 3 weeks, and ∼100\% in 6 weeks.}

Populations on the northern coasts of the Spanish Mediterranean Sea seemed to be unaffected (Catalonian region). Histological examination of affected individuals revealed the presence of a haplosporidan-like parasite within the digestive gland being probably the pathogen that causes this mortality. The present MME has spread rapidly, causing high mortality rates in infected populations. Taking into account the degree of impact, the geographic extent, and the high probability that the infection is still in a spreading phase, this might be considered the largest MME ever registered for P. nobilis up to date, forcing this emblematic bivalve into a critical viability status over hundreds of kilometers of coast.}

  abstract        = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The Mediterranean endemic fan mussel Pinna nobilis is suffering an ongoing basin-scale mass mortality event (MME) since 2016. As most Mediterranean populations have collapsed, the species has been declared as Critically Endangered in the IUCN Red List of threatened species. In an effort to track the progress of the MME and provide updated information on the status of the species in the Greek seas, we compiled data collected through dedicated surveys and opportunistic assessments during 2019 and 2020. A total of 14589 fan mussel individuals, of which 81.1{\%} dead, were recorded in 258 site surveys. Of the remaining 2762 live individuals, 256 were juveniles. Two marine areas which still sustain living populations were identified, namely Kalloni Gulf (Lesvos Island), and Laganas Bay (Zakynthos Island). The inner part of Kalloni Gulf appears to maintain the largest surviving population of the species in the eastern Mediterranean, with an abundance estimate of 684000 individuals (95{\%} confidence interval: 322000-1453000). Solitary, potentially resistant, scattered individuals were recorded in several sites. Other previously abundant populations that had been assessed in the past, specifically those of Lake Vouliagmeni (Korinthiakos Gulf), Souda Bay (Crete) and Gera Gulf (Lesvos Island), and which collectively summed up to {\~{}}350,000 individuals, have now been wiped out. Our results document the collapse of most P. nobilis populations throughout the Greek seas. The MME has substantially progressed between early 2019 and mid-2020, as indicated by the increase of mortality at sites consecutively monitored multiple times. This work highlights the urgent need for continuous monitoring of surviving populations and calls for the immediate implementation of an effective protection and management strategy that will ensure the persistence of surviving individuals and the production of resistant offspring.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

  abstract        = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The fan mussel, Pinna nobilis, represents the largest bivalve endemic to the Mediterranean Sea. Since 2016, dramatic mass mortality of this species has been observed in several areas. The first surveys suggested that Haplosporidium pinnae (currently considered species-specific) was the main etiological agent, but recent studies have indicated that a multifactorial disease may be responsible for this phenomenon. In this study, we performed molecular diagnostic analyses on P. nobilis, P. rudis, and bivalve heterologous host species from the island of Sardinia to shed further light on the pathogens involved in the mass mortality. The results support the occurrence of a multifactorial disease and that Mycobacterium spp. and H. pinnae are not necessarily associated with the illness. Indeed, our analyses revealed that H. pinnae is not species-specific for P. nobilis, as it was present in other bivalves at least three years before the mass mortality began, and species of Mycobacterium were also found in healthy individuals of P. nobilis and P. rudis. We also detected the species Rhodococcus erythropolis, representing the first report in fan mussels of a bacterium other than Mycobacterium spp. and Vibrio spp. These results depict a complicated scenario, further demonstrating how the P. nobilis mass mortality event is far from being fully understood.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

  abstract        = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The endemic fan mussel (Pinna nobilis) in the Mediterranean Sea is at high risk of disappearance due to massive mortality events. The aim of the study was to evaluate the antioxidant response of P. nobilis collected in the Balearic Islands (Western Mediterranean) before and after the mass mortality event. Individuals collected before (between 2011 and 2012) and after (between 2016 and 2017) the event were analyzed by histological, molecular, and biochemical methods to compare pathogenic loads and biochemical responses. All the individuals collected during 2016–2017 presented symptoms of the disease and were positive for Haplosporidium pinnae, while acid-fast bacteria or/and Gram-negative bacteria were detected in some individuals of both sampling periods. The activities of the antioxidant enzymes catalase and superoxide dismutase in the gills were significantly lower in P. nobilis affected with the parasite compared to those in the asymptomatic ones, while levels of malondialdehyde, as an indicator of lipid peroxidation, were higher in infected individuals. When analyzing the differential effects of H. pinnae and Mycobacterium sp. on P. nobilis, it was observed that significant effects on biomarkers were only observed in the presence of H. pinnae. Co-infection of P. nobilis by H. pinnae with other pathogens such as Mycobacterium sp. constitutes a serious problem due to its high mortality rate in the Balearic Island waters. This concerning situation for P. nobilis is favored by a reduction in antioxidant defenses related to H. pinnae infection that induces oxidative stress and cell damage.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

At the start of the nineteenth century, almost every bay and harbour, around the coast had abundant beds of native oysters. Intensive dredging to meet the demands of the markets in Dublin and England depleted the stocks, so that in 1845 the government passed legislation to permit the formation of private oyster beds to improve the ailing stocks. According to the book on “Shellfish {\&} Shellfisheries of Ireland” (Wilkins, 2004) Irish stocks began to collapse between 1850 and 1860. By the second half of the twentieth century, only the beds of Tralee Bay, Galway Bay and Clew Bay were still yielding a good return for local fishermen.$\backslash$nThe arrival of the oyster parasite Bonamia ostreae in the mid 1980s was an additional blow to the Irish native oyster stocks.

  abstract  = {Malaria transmission is known to be strongly impacted by temperature. The current understanding of how temperature affects mosquito and parasite life history traits derives from a limited number of empirical studies. These studies, some dating back to the early part of last century, are often poorly controlled, have limited replication, explore a narrow range of temperatures, and use a mixture of parasite and mosquito species. Here, we use a single pairing of the Asian mosquito vector, An. stephensi and the human malaria parasite, P. falciparum to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the thermal performance curves of a range of mosquito and parasite traits relevant to transmission. We show that biting rate, adult mortality rate, parasite development rate, and vector competence are temperature sensitive. Importantly, we find qualitative and quantitative differences to the assumed temperature-dependent relationships. To explore the overall implications of temperature for transmission, we first use a standard model of relative vectorial capacity. This approach suggests a temperature optimum for transmission of 29°C, with minimum and maximum temperatures of 12°C and 38°C, respectively. However, the robustness of the vectorial capacity approach is challenged by the fact that the empirical data violate several of the model’s simplifying assumptions. Accordingly, we present an alternative model of relative force of infection that better captures the observed biology of the vector–parasite interaction. This model suggests a temperature optimum for transmission of 26°C, with a minimum and maximum of 17°C and 35°C, respectively. The differences between the models lead to potentially divergent predictions for the potential impacts of current and future climate change on malaria transmission. The study provides a framework for more detailed, system-specific studies that are essential to develop an improved understanding on the effects of temperature on malaria transmission.}

To facilitate model development, simulation algorithms must provide an accurate representation of the system, while performing the simulation in a reasonable amount of time. Gillespie's stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA) accurately depicts spatially homogeneous models with small populations of chemical species and properly represents noise, but it is often abandoned when modeling larger systems because of its computational complexity. In this work, we examine the performance of different versions of the SSA when applied to several biochemical models. Through our analysis, we discover that transient changes in reaction execution frequencies, which are typical of biochemical models with gene induction and repression, can dramatically affect simulator performance. To account for these shifts, we propose a new algorithm called the sorting direct method that maintains a loosely sorted order of the reactions as the simulation executes. Our measurements show that the sorting direct method performs favorably when compared to other well-known exact stochastic simulation algorithms.}

However, many of the basic formulae forR0 break down when we consider transmission of infection to be a stochastic process involving discrete individuals. This paper clarifies why and when these differences arise and predicts when individual-based considerations are likely to be important in modelling infection dynamics.}

Current knowledge suggests that FP is an emerging infectious disease, with the prevalence varying both spatially and temporally, even between localities in close proximity to each other. A high prevalence of FP in marine turtles has been correlated with residency in areas of reduced water quality, indicating that there is an environmental influence on disease presentation. Chelonid herpesvirus 5 (ChHV5) has been identified as the likely aetiological agent of FP. The current taxonomic position of ChHV5 is in the family Herpesviridae, subfamily Alphaherpesvirinae, genus Scutavirus. Molecular differentiation of strains has revealed that a viral variant is typically present at specific locations, even within sympatric species of marine turtles, indicating that the disease FP originates regionally. There is uncertainty surrounding the exact path of transmission and the conditions that facilitate lesion development, although recent research has identified atypical genes within the genome of ChHV5 that may play a role in pathogenesis. This review discusses emerging areas where researchers might focus and theories behind the emergence of FP globally since the 1980s, which appear to be a multi-factorial interplay between the virus, the host and environmental factors influencing disease expression.}

  abstract = {The extinction of species across the globe is accelerating directly or indirectly from human activities. Biological impoverishment, habitat fragmentation, climate change, increasing toxification, and the rapid global movement of people and other living organisms have worked synergistically to diminish ecosystem function. This has resulted in unprecedented levels of disease emergence driven by human-induced environmental degradation, which poses a threat to the survival and health of biodiversity. What is often overlooked in the discussion of the health consequences to humans is that critically endangered wildlife species are at grave risk of extinction by disease outbreaks. As habitat becomes more compressed and with migration routes cut off, gene pools of small species are stranded in isolated habitat fragments. Species now are vulnerable to encroachment, malnutrition, environmental pollutants, and epidemics from domestic animals and humans. Furthermore, the continuous degradation of ecosystems is leading to increased stress, immunosuppression, and greater susceptibility to disease. Disease can be catastrophic to a diminished stressed population, becoming in some instances the leading factor of local, regional, and global extinctions. The strategies of the new field of conservation medicine include long-term monitoring, health assessment, and interventions to protect species at risk. We particularly must minimize the threat of any potentially catastrophic disease outbreaks resulting from anthropogenic changes to the environment. Current and future diagnostic molecular techniques offer new opportunities to identify tools for the management and possible treatment of diseases in imperiled species.}

  abstract = {This paper considers an epidemic model of a vector-borne disease which has direct mode of transmission in addition to the vector-mediated transmission. The incidence term is assumed to be of the bilinear mass-action form. We include both a baseline ODE version of the model, and, a differential-delay model with a discrete time delay. The ODE model shows that the dynamics is completely determined by the basic reproduction number R0. If R0⩽1, the disease-free equilibrium is globally stable and the disease dies out. If R0>1, a unique endemic equilibrium exists and is locally asymptotically stable in the interior of the feasible region. The delay in the differential-delay model accounts for the incubation time the vectors need to become infectious. We study the effect of that delay on the stability of the equilibria. We show that the introduction of a time delay in the host-to-vector transmission term can destabilize the system and periodic solutions can arise through Hopf bifurcation.}

First, we extended the model by taking into account the exposed individuals in both human and vector population with the impact of disease related deaths and total time dependent population size. Using Lyapunov function theory some sufficient conditions for global stability of both the disease-free equilibrium and the endemic equilibrium are obtained. For the basic reproductive number R0>1, a unique endemic equilibrium exists and is globally asymptotically stable. Furthermore, it is found that the model exhibits the phenomenon of backward bifurcation, where the stable disease-free equilibria coexists with a stable endemic equilibrium. Finally, numerical simulations are carried out to investigate the influence of the key parameters on the spread of the vector-borne disease, to support the analytical conclusion and illustrate possible behavioral scenarios of the model.}

This review describes our current understanding of virus transmission by aphids, thrips, whiteflies, leafhoppers, planthoppers, treehoppers, mites, nematodes, and zoosporic endoparasites. Strategies for control of vectors by host resistance, chemicals, and integrated pest management are reviewed. Many gaps in the knowledge of the transmission mechanisms and a lack of available host resistance to vectors are evident. Advances in genome sequencing and molecular technologies will help to address these problems and will allow innovative control methods through interference with vector transmission. Improved knowledge of factors affecting pest and disease spread in different ecosystems for predictive modeling is also needed. Innovative control measures are urgently required because of the increased risks from vector-borne infections that arise from environmental change.}

It is also shown that the basic reproduction number of the time-averaged autonomous system is applicable in the case where both the matrix of new infection rate and the matrix of transition and dissipation within infectious compartments are diagonal, but it may underestimate and overestimate infection risks in other cases. The global dynamics of a periodic epidemic model with patch structure is analyzed in order to study the impact of periodic contacts or periodic migrations on the disease transmission.}

The first term is similar to the case of a constant vector population p but with p replaced by the average vector population p0. The maximum correction due to the second term is ($\epsilon$2/8){\%} and always tends to decrease R0. The basic reproduction number R0 is defined through the spectral radius of a linear integral operator. Four numerical methods for the computation of R0 are compared using as example a model for the 2005/2006 chikungunya epidemic in La R{\'e}union. The approximate formula and the numerical methods can be used for many other epidemic models with seasonality.},

  abstract = {We first study an SIR system of differential equations with periodic coefficients describing an epidemic in a seasonal environment. Unlike in a constant environment, the final epidemic size may not be an increasing function of the basic reproduction number ℛ0 or of the initial fraction of infected people. Moreover, large epidemics can happen even if ℛ0<1. But like in a constant environment, the final epidemic size tends to 0 when ℛ0<1 and the initial fraction of infected people tends to 0. When ℛ0>1, the final epidemic size is bigger than the fraction 1−1/ℛ0 of the initially nonimmune population. In summary, the basic reproduction number ℛ0 keeps its classical threshold property but many other properties are no longer true in a seasonal environment. These theoretical results should be kept in mind when analyzing data for emerging vector-borne diseases (West-Nile, dengue, chikungunya) or air-borne diseases (SARS, pandemic influenza); all these diseases being influenced by seasonality.}

The next generation matrix approach to deriving and calculating the basic reproduction number of a plant virus epidemic is described. The approach is illustrated through a series of examples of increasing complexity, ranging from the simplest case of one vector transmitting one virus to a single host, to the case of multiple vectors, to combined horizontal (vector) and vertical (seed) transmission, and where vector control using insecticides is practised. The importance of parameters representing host and vector population dynamics and their interaction in the absence of disease is stressed, and the constraints these place on the calculation of the basic reproduction number.

  abstract = {Xylella fastidiosa is an important plant pathogen that attacks several plants of economic importance. Once restricted to the Americas, the bacterium, which causes olive quick decline syndrome, was discovered near Lecce, Italy in 2013. Since the initial outbreak, it has invaded 23,000 ha of olives in the Apulian Region, southern Italy, and is of great concern throughout Mediterranean basin. Therefore, predicting its spread and estimating the efficacy of control are of utmost importance. As data on this invasive infectious disease are poor, we have developed a spatially-explicit simulation model for X. fastidiosa to provide guidance for predicting spread in the early stages of invasion and inform management strategies. The model qualitatively and quantitatively predicts the patterns of spread. We model control zones currently employed in Apulia, showing that increasing buffer widths decrease infection risk beyond the control zone, but this may not halt the spread completely due to stochastic long-distance jumps caused by vector dispersal. Therefore, management practices should aim to reduce vector long-distance dispersal. We find optimal control scenarios that minimise control effort while reducing X. fastidiosa spread maximally---suggesting that increasing buffer zone widths should be favoured over surveillance efforts as control budgets increase. Our model highlights the importance of non-olive hosts which increase the spread rate of the disease and may lead to an order of magnitude increase in risk. Many aspects of X. fastidiosa disease invasion remain uncertain and hinder forecasting; we recommend future studies investigating quantification of the infection growth rate, and short and long distance dispersal.}

Partial differential equations offer a rich and flexible modeling framework that has been applied to a large number of invasions. In this article, we are specifically interested in dating and localizing the introduction that led to an invasion using mathematical modeling, post-introduction data and an adequate statistical inference procedure. We adopt a mechanistic-statistical approach grounded on a coupled reaction--diffusion--absorption model representing the dynamics of an organism in an heterogeneous domain with respect to growth. Initial conditions (including the date and site of the introduction) and model parameters related to diffusion, reproduction and mortality are jointly estimated in the Bayesian framework by using an adaptive importance sampling algorithm. This framework is applied to the invasion of Xylella fastidiosa, a phytopathogenic bacterium detected in South Corsica in 2015, France.}

  abstract = {For vector-borne plant pathogens, disease epidemics may be attributable to multiple mechanisms, including introduction of a novel vector whose epidemiological role differs from that of native vectors. In such cases, understanding an exotic vector’s ability to drive an epidemic is central to mitigating its impact. We studied how the invasive glassy-winged sharpshooter (Homalodisca vitripennis Germar) can drive Pierce’s disease outbreaks in vineyards, focusing on its potential to promote vine-to-vine (i.e., secondary) spread of Xylella fastidiosa relative to potential constraints stemming from seasonality in the pathosystem. First, we developed a general vector-borne disease model to understand the consequences for disease dynamics of (i) seasonal acquisition efficiency and (ii) seasonal host recovery from infection. Results of the modeling indicate that these two sources of seasonality could constrain disease incidence, particularly when working in concert. Next, we established a field cage experiment to determine whether H. vitripennis promotes vine-to-vine spread, and looked for evidence of seasonality in spread. Broadly, results from the experiment supported assumptions of the model; there was modest to significant increase in the frequency of pathogen spread over the first season, and those new infections that occurred later in the season were more likely to recover during winter. Ultimately, by the end of the second season, there was not evidence of significant secondary spread, likely due to a combination of seasonal constraints and low transmission efficiency by H. vitripennis. Collectively, these results suggest that, although H. vitripennis may be able to promote vine-to-vine spread in certain contexts, it may not be the key factor explaining its impact. Rather, the ability of H. vitripennis to drive epidemics is likely to be more directly related to its potential to reach higher population densities than native vectors.}

  abstract = {Summary Unravelling the ecological structure of emerging plant pathogens persisting in multi-host systems is challenging. In such systems, observations are often heterogeneous with respect to time, space and host species, and may lead to biases of perception. The biased perception of pathogen ecology may be exacerbated by hidden fractions of the whole host population, which may act as infection reservoirs. We designed a mechanistic-statistical approach to help understand the ecology of emerging pathogens by filtering out some biases of perception. This approach, based on SIR (Susceptible–Infected–Removed) models and a Bayesian framework, disentangles epidemiological and observational processes underlying temporal counting data. We applied our approach to French surveillance data on Xylella fastidiosa, a multi-host pathogenic bacterium recently discovered in Corsica, France. A model selection led to two diverging scenarios: one scenario without a hidden compartment and an introduction around 2001, and the other with a hidden compartment and an introduction around 1985. Thus, Xylella fastidiosa was probably introduced into Corsica much earlier than its discovery, and its control could be arduous under the hidden compartment scenario. From a methodological perspective, our approach provides insights into the dynamics of emerging plant pathogens and, in particular, the potential existence of infection reservoirs.}

This perspective aims to show how a model framework, developed originally for plant virus diseases, can be modified for the case of diseases incited by Xylella fastidiosa. In particular, the model framework enables the specification of a simple but quite general invasion criterion defined in terms of key plant, pathogen, and vector parameters and, importantly, their interactions, which determine whether or not an incursion or isolated outbreak of a pathogen will lead to establishment, persistence, and subsequent epidemic development. Hence, this approach is applicable to the wide range of X. fastidiosa-incited diseases that have recently emerged in southern Europe, each with differing host plant, pathogen subspecies, and vector identities. Of particular importance are parameters relating to vector abundance and activity, transmission characteristics, and behavior in relation to preferences for host infection status. Some gaps in knowledge with regard to the developing situation in Europe are noted.}

However, to be used in decision-making, they must be carefully parametrized and validated with epidemiological data as well as biological information on the relevant players. Here, benefitting of the Olive Quick Decline Syndrome (OQDS) outbreak, which has occurred in Southern Italy since 2013, an epidemiological model describing this epidemic is presented. Beside the bacterium Xylella fastidiosa, the OQDS main players considered in the model are its insect vectors, Philaenus spumarius, and the host plants (olive trees and weeds) of the insects and of the bacterium. The model is based on a system of ordinary differential equations, the analysis of which have provided interesting results about possible equilibria of the epidemic system and guidelines for its numerical simulations. These, under a variety of parameter scenarios, have led to the model sensitivity analysis, hence to understanding the parameters relative importance in the transmission of the disease. Although the model presented here is mathematically rather simplified, its analysis has highlighted threshold parameters that could be the target of control strategies within the integrated pest management framework, not requiring the removal of the productive resource represented by the olive trees. Indeed numerical simulations support the outcomes of the mathematical analysis according to which a removal of a suitable amount of weeds biomass (reservoir of Xylella fastidiosa) from olive orchards and surrounding areas resulted the most efficient strategy to control the spread of the OQDS. In addition, as expected, the adoption of more resistant olive tree cultivars has been shown to be a good strategy, though less cost-effective, in controlling the pathogen.}

Our observation on host plant selection revealed that there was a strong preference of N. campestris nymphs for plants belonging to the family Poaceae. On the contrary, P. spumarius nymphs were polyphagous. The most preferable plants for the nymphs of this species belonged to the families Asteraceae and Fabaceae.

Four xylem-sap-feeding insect species were found within and bordering olive orchards across Salento during a survey carried out from October 2013 to December 2014: P. spumarius was the most abundant species on non-olive vegetation in olive orchards as well as on olive foliage and was the only species that consistently tested positive for the presence of X. fastidiosa using real-time PCR. P. spumarius, whose nymphs develop within spittle on weeds during the spring, are likely to move from weeds beneath olive trees to olive canopy during the dry period (May to October 2014). The first X. fastidiosa-infective P. spumarius were collected in May from olive canopy: all the individuals previously collected on weeds tested negative for the bacterium. Experiments demonstrated that P. spumarius transmitted X. fastidiosa from infected to uninfected olive plants. Moreover, P. spumarius acquired X. fastidiosa from several host plant species in the field, with the highest acquisition rate from olive, polygala and acacia. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed bacterial cells resembling X. fastidiosa in the foreguts of adult P. spumarius. The data presented here are essential to plan an effective IPM strategy and limit further spread of the fastidious bacterium.}

  abstract   = {Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that avoids the random walk behavior and sensitivity to correlated parameters that plague many MCMC methods by taking a series of steps informed by first-order gradient information. These features allow it to converge to high-dimensional target distributions much more quickly than simpler methods such as random walk Metropolis or Gibbs sampling. However, HMC's performance is highly sensitive to two user-specified parameters: a step size ε and a desired number of steps L. In particular, if L is too small then the algorithm exhibits undesirable random walk behavior, while if L is too large the algorithm wastes computation. We introduce the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS), an extension to HMC that eliminates the need to set a number of steps L. NUTS uses a recursive algorithm to build a set of likely candidate points that spans a wide swath of the target distribution, stopping automatically when it starts to double back and retrace its steps. Empirically, NUTS performs at least as efficiently as (and sometimes more effciently than) a well tuned standard HMC method, without requiring user intervention or costly tuning runs. We also derive a method for adapting the step size parameter ε on the fly based on primal-dual averaging. NUTS can thus be used with no hand-tuning at all, making it suitable for applications such as BUGS-style automatic inference engines that require efficient "turnkey" samplers.},

  abstract = {Droughts highlighted California's unsustainable use of groundwater. Now, the state is trying to refill its aquifers. California's Central Valley—one of the most productive and lucrative agricultural regions in the world—is sinking. The subsidence, which damages roads, bridges, and irrigation canals, results from decades of groundwater pumping. Excessive pumping also jeopardizes water quality, as salts and agrochemicals accumulate within aquifers and arsenic is released from clays. In 2014, California launched a landmark effort to save its groundwater. Now, local water managers have developed the first sustainability plans for the state's most imperiled aquifers. The state is funding scientists to gather better data on the crisis, and geologists are working to identify the best places to replenish aquifers by flooding farm fields—and even devising strategies to clean the water as it seeps into the ground. There will be challenges to reaching groundwater sustainability, including climate change. But getting research and policy innovation involved could be broadly relevant. Globally, aquifers are "highly stressed" in 17 countries that hold one-quarter of the world's population, threatening water and food supplies for billions of people.}

  abstract       = {Xylella fastidiosa (Xf) is a vascular plant pathogen native to the Americas. In 2013, it was first reported in Europe, implicated in a massive die-off of olive trees in Apulia, Italy. This finding prompted mandatory surveys across Europe, successively revealing that the bacterium was already established in some distant areas of the western Mediterranean. To date, the Balearic Islands (Spain) hold the major known genetic diversity of Xf in Europe. Since October 2016, four sequence types (ST) belonging to the subspecies fastidiosa (ST1), multiplex (ST7, ST81), and pauca (ST80) have been identified infecting 28 host species, including grapevines, almond, olive, and fig trees. ST1 causes Pierce’s disease (PD) and together with ST81 are responsible for almond leaf scorch disease (ALSD) in California, from where they were introduced into Mallorca in around 1993, very likely via infected almond scions brought for grafting. To date, almond leaf scorch disease affects over 81\% of almond trees and Pierce’s disease is widespread in vineyards across Mallorca, although producing on average little economic impact. In this perspective, we present and analyze a large Xf-hosts database accumulated over four years of field surveys, laboratory sample analyses, and research to understand the underlying causes of Xf emergence and spread among crops and wild plants in the Balearic Islands. The impact of Xf on the landscape is discussed.}

Surveys of commercial orchards detected only very low populations of known or suspected ALS vectors in areas which had a high incidence of ALS. In contrast, many almond-growing districts in central California which had a high incidence of Pierce’s disease in grapes but only rare infections of almond trees with ALS had much higher populations of D. minerva and C. fulgida. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that D. minerva is not the principal vector of ALS in California.}},

Xylella fastidiosa pauca ST53 is the plant pathogenic bacterium responsible for the disease, and the adult Meadow Spittlebug, Philaenus spumarius (L.) (Hemiptera Aphrophoridae), is its main vector. This study proposes a lattice model for the pathogen invasion of olive orchard aimed at identifying an appropriate strategy for arresting the infection, built on the management of the vector throughout its entire life cycle. In our model the olive orchard is depicted as a simple square lattice with olive trees and herbaceous vegetation distributed on the lattice sites in order to mimic the typical structure of an olive orchard; adult vectors are represented by particles moving on the lattice according to rules dictated by the interplay between vector and vegetation life cycles or phenology; the transmission process of the bacterium is regulated by a stochastic Susceptible, Infected and Removed model. On this baseline model, we build-up a proper Integrated Pest Management strategy based on tailoring, timing, and tuning of available control actions. We demonstrate that it is possible to reverse the hitherto unstoppable Xylella fastidiosa pauca ST53 invasion, by a rational vector and transmission control strategy.}

  abstract  = {The pathology of diseases such as Pierce{\textquoteright}s disease (PD) of grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.) that are caused by the xylem-limited bacterium Xylella fastidiosa (Xf) is widely attributed to vessel occlusion and subsequent water deficits. Grapevines (Vitis vinifera L. Chardonnay) were exposed to water deficits, stem inoculation with Xf, and combinations of both to evaluate whether symptoms of PD were a consequence of water deficits. When vines were inoculated with Xf and exposed to water deficits, more extensive PD symptoms developed throughout the plant than when infected vines were well watered. However, vines infected with Xf exhibited symptoms unique to PD that included inhibited periderm development in stems (green islands), leaf blade separation from the petiole (matchsticks), and irregular leaf scorch. Vines exposed to water deficits and not Xf displayed accelerated periderm development, basal leaf abscission at the stem/petiole junction, and uniform leaf chlorosis. Water deficits induced the development of an abscission zone at the stem/petiole junction, but PD did not. Pierce{\textquoteright}s disease symptoms could not be produced with any of several water-deficit treatments, including severing all but one secondary vein near the leaf tip. Results indicate that factors other than water deficits are involved in producing the symptoms of PD. The widely accepted hypothesis that PD-infected plants develop water deficits that cause green islands, matchsticks, localized leaf scorch, and eventual death of vines should be reevaluated.},

  abstractnote = {The interface between mathematics and biology has long been a rich area of research, with mutual benefit to each supporting discipline. Traditional areas of investigation, such as population genetics, ecology, neurobiology, and 3-D reconstructions, have flourished, despite a rather meager environment for the funding of such work. In the past twenty years, the kind and scope of such interactions between mathematicians and biologists have changed dramatically, reaching out to encompass areas of both biology and mathematics that previously had not benefited. At the same time, with the closer integration of theory and experiment, and the increased reliance on high-speed computation, the costs of such research grew, though not the opportunities for funding. The perception became reinforced, both within the research community and at funding agencies, that although these interactions were expanding, they were not doing so at the rate necessary to meet the opportunities and needs. A workshop was held in Washington, DC, between April 28 and May 3, 1990 which drew together a broadly based group of researchers to synthesize conclusions from a group of working papers and extended discussions. The result is the report presented here, which we hope will provide a guide and stimulus to research in mathematical and computational biology for at least the next decade. The report identifies a number of grand challenges, representing a broad consensus among the participants.},

  abstract  = {The progression of anatomical symptoms of Pierce{\textquoteright}s disease in susceptible Vitis vinifera cv. Chardonnay grapevines was studied over a time course following controlled inoculation of Y{\textemdash}shaped, two-shooted plants with Xylella fastidiosa. Leaf, petiole, and stem tissue samples collected from locations on inoculated and noninoculated shoots were taken at 10, 14, and 18 weeks following inoculation. After 10 weeks, leaf necrosis was visible in the inoculated shoots. Leaf and petiole xylem was predominantly occluded with gums and bacteria, whereas stem xylem was occluded almost exclusively with tyloses. After 14 weeks, bacteria and gums were found in noninoculated shoots, but tyloses were absent from these stem tissues. At 18 weeks, tylose development was observed in the xylem in stems of noninoculated shoots. Consequently, basipetal movement of bacteria occurred from the inoculated shoot into a noninoculated shoot. Results indicate that there is a predictable initial sequence of symptoms within infected shoots: gum and bacterial accumulation in leaves and petioles followed by tylose formation in stem tissue. This pattern is repeated with colonization of new shoots, eventually creating a systemic presence of the disease.Acknowledgments: Funding for this research was provided from the California Department of Food and Agriculture, agreement no. 01-0712. The authors would like to thank the cooperative efforts in maintaining bacterial cultures and inoculating grapevines from the Bruce Kirkpatrick lab, including M. Caroline Roper, and the preliminary anatomical contributions made by Philip Bates.},

The combination (upper and lower threshold) with the lowest C. V. were accepted as the theoretical developmental thresholds. These values were 2.8°C for the lower threshold and 26.7°C for the upper. Heat unit (HU) calculations based on these thresholds were used to estimate the duration of various nymphal stages. Once hatching began, an accumulation of 670 HU (°C) resulted in 50\% adult emergence. The lengths of the nymphal stages were 225, 190, 190, 190, and 290 HU for the 1st through 5th nymphal stages, respectively. The nymphal density in the field during the period following final hatch to 1st adult emergence was found to adequately fit the Poisson distribution. }},
