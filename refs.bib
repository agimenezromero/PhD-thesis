  abstract = {The decreasing seawater pH trend associated with increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide levels is an issue of concern due to possible negative consequences for marine organisms, especially calcifiers. Globally, coastal areas represent important transitional land-ocean zones with complex interactions between biological, physical and chemical processes. Here, we evaluated the pH variability at two sites in the coastal area of the Balearic Sea (Western Mediterranean). High resolution pH data along with temperature, salinity, and also dissolved oxygen were obtained with autonomous sensors from 2018 to 2021 in order to determine the temporal pH variability and the principal drivers involved. By using environmental datasets of temperature, salinity and dissolved oxygen, Recurrent Neural Networks were trained to predict pH and fill data gaps. Longer environmental time series (2012--2021) were used to obtain the pH trend using reconstructed data. The best predictions show a rate of {\$}{\$}-{\backslash},0.0020{\backslash}pm 0.00054{\$}{\$}pH units year{\$}{\$}^{\{}-1{\}}{\$}{\$}, which is in good agreement with other observations of pH rates in coastal areas. The methodology presented here opens the possibility to obtain pH trends when only limited pH observations are available, if other variables are accessible. Potentially, this could be a way to reliably fill the unavoidable gaps present in time series data provided by sensors.},

  abstract = { Emerging marine infectious diseases pose a substantial threat to marine ecosystems and the conservation of their biodiversity. Compartmental models of epidemic transmission in marine sessile organisms, available only recently, are based on non-spatial descriptions in which space is homogenized and parasite mobility is not explicitly accounted for. However, in realistic scenarios epidemic transmission is conditioned by the spatial distribution of hosts and the parasites' mobility patterns, calling for an explicit description of space. In this work, we develop a spatially explicit individual-based model to study disease transmission by waterborne parasites in sessile marine populations. We investigate the impact of spatial disease transmission through extensive numerical simulations and theoretical analysis. Specifically, the effects of parasite mobility into the epidemic threshold and the temporal progression of the epidemic are assessed. We show that larger values of pathogen mobility imply more severe epidemics, as the number of infections increases, and shorter timescales to extinction. An analytical expression for the basic reproduction number of the spatial model, R~0, is derived as a function of the non-spatial counterpart, R0, which characterizes a transition between a disease-free and a propagation phase, in which the disease propagates over a large fraction of the system. }
